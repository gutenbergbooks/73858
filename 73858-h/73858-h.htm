<h2>NOTE </h2>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">It</span> would be quite easy to maintain that these twelve 
fragments which come to us from the childhood of 
Charlotte Brontë should not be perpetuated for the 
public in the printed page. They were written 
between the ages of twelve and twenty-one, and it 
was certainly never for a moment contemplated by 
the author that they would ever see the light. They 
were handed to me in a little house in Banagher in 
Ireland, nearly thirty years ago, by the Rev. Arthur 
Bell Nicholls, the husband of Charlotte Brontë, who 
in a letter before me explains that they would have 
been burnt had I not come upon the scene. The 
ever-increasing fame of Charlotte Brontë in the 
intervening years has gone on side by side with an 
immense literature devoted to child psychology. It 
is as a contribution to that science that I have been 
frequently exhorted to publish them. A natural 
indolence would have prevented this had not my 
friend, Mr. C. W. Hatfield, come to the rescue by 
diligently transcribing the minute handwriting and 
preparing the volume with certain useful notes for 
publication. </p>

<h2><a href="#chap01" id="chap01"></a>THE TWELVE ADVENTURERS </h2>


<div class="ednote">
<p>‘<span class="smcap">The</span> Twelve Adventurers’ is the first of two stories in the 
earliest of Charlotte Brontë’s manuscripts, and was written 
by her when she was only twelve years of age. </p>

<p>Her early admiration for the hero of the story, the 
‘Great Duke,’ was first noted by Mrs. Gaskell in <i>The Life 
of Charlotte Brontë</i>, 1857, vol. i. p. 94, where she says: </p>

<p class="blockquote">All that related to him (the Duke of Wellington) belonged to 
the heroic age. Did Charlotte want a knight-errant, or a 
devoted lover, the Marquis of Douro, or Lord Charles Wellesley, 
came ready to her hand. There is hardly one of her prose 
writings at this time in which…their ‘august father’ does 
not appear as a sort of Jupiter Tonans, or Deus ex Machinâ. </p>

<p>The country ‘discovered’ by the twelve adventurers 
became the scene of nearly all the stories written by 
Charlotte Brontë during the following eleven years. Originally 
named ‘The Country of the Genii,’ the fairies deserted 
it after Charlotte’s school-days at Roe Head (1831-1832), 
and the country was re-named ‘The Kingdom of Angria.’ 
The ‘great city’ became ‘The Glass Town’ or ‘Verreopolis,’ 
which was afterwards changed to ‘Verdopolis,’ the 
chief city of Angria. </p>

<h3>CHAPTER I <br>

<small>THE COUNTRY OF THE GENII </small></h3>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">There</span> is a tradition that some thousands of years 
ago twelve men from Britain, of a most gigantic size, 
and twelve men from Gaul, came over to the country 
of the genii, and while here were continually at war 
with each other; and, after remaining many years, 
returned again to Britain and Gaul. In the inhabited 
parts of the genii countries there are now no vestiges 
of them, though it is said there have been found 
some colossal skeletons in that wild, barren sand, 
the evil desert. </p>

<p>I have read a book called <i>The Travels of Captain 
Parnell</i>, out of which the following is an extract: </p>

<p class="blockquote">About four in the afternoon I saw a dark red cloud arise 
in the east, which gradually grew larger till it covered the 
whole sky. As the cloud spread the wind rose and blew a 
tremendous hurricane. The sand of the desert began to 
move and rolled like the waves of the sea. As soon as I saw 
this I threw myself on my face and stopped my breath, for 
I knew that this was a tornado or whirlwind. I remained 
in this situation for three minutes; at the end of that time 
I ventured to look up. The whirlwind had passed over and 
had not hurt me, but close by lay my poor camel quite dead. 
At this sight I could not forbear weeping; but my attention 
was soon diverted by another object. About one 
hundred yards further off lay an immense skeleton. I 
immediately ran up to it and examined it closely. While 
I was gazing at the long ghastly figure which lay stretched 
upon the sand before me the thought came into my mind 
that it might be the skeleton of one of those ancient Britons 
who, tradition tells us, came from their own country to this 
evil land, and here miserably perished. While I was pursuing 
this train of meditation, I observed that it was bound 
with a long chain of rusty iron. Suddenly the iron clanked 
and the bones strove to rise, but a huge mountain of sand 
overwhelmed the skeleton with a tremendous crash, and 
when the dust which had hid the sun and enveloped everything 
in darkness cleared away, not a mark could be distinguished to 
show the future traveller where the bones 
had lain. </p>

<p>Now, if this account be true—and I see no reason 
why we should suppose it is not—I think we may 
fairly conclude that these skeletons are evil genii 
chained in these deserts by the fairy Maimoune.<sup><a id="note1text"></a><a href="#note1">*</a></sup> </p>

<p>There are several other traditions, but they are 
all so obscure that no reliance is to be placed on 
them. </p>

<h3>CHAPTER II <br>

<small>THE VOYAGE OF DISCOVERY </small></h3>

<p style="padding-bottom:0.5em">In the year 1798 the <i>Invincible</i>, 74 guns, set sail 
with a fair wind from England; her crew, twelve 
men, every one healthy and stout and in the best 
temper. Their names were as follows:— </p>

        <td>Arthur Wellesley.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Francis Stewart,</td>
        <td></td>
    </tr>
</table>

<p style="padding-top:0.5em">Well, as I said before, we set sail with a fair wind 
from England on the 1st of March 1798. On the 
15th we came in sight of Spain. On the 16th we 
landed, bought a supply of provisions, and set sail 
again on the 20th. On the 25th, about noon, Henry 
Clinton, who was in the shrouds, cried out that he 
saw the Oxeye. </p>

<p>In a minute we were all on deck and gazing 
eagerly and fearfully towards the mountain over 
which we saw hanging in the sky the ominous speck. 
Instantly the sails were furled, the ship tacked about, 
and the boat was made ready for launching in our 
last extremity. </p>

<p>Thus having made everything ready, we retired to 
the cabin, and every one looked as sheepish as possible 
and noway inclined to meet our fate like men. 
Some of us began to cry; but we waited a long time 
and heard no sound of the wind, and the cloud did 
not increase in size. </p>

<p>At last Marcus O’Donell exclaimed: ‘I wish it 
would either go backward or forward.’ </p>

<p>At this Stewart reproved him, and Ferdinand 
gave him a box on the ear. O’Donell returned the 
compliment; but just then we heard the sound of 
the wind, and Ronald shouted out: </p>

<p>‘The cloud is as big as me!’ </p>

<p>Brunswick pulled Ronald away from the window, 
and ordered him to hold his tongue. Ronald said 
he would not and began to sing. Felix de Rothsay 
put his hand over Ronald’s mouth. Harold FitzGeorge got 
Rothsay behind the throat. Ernest 
Fortescue held his fist in O’Donell’s face, and Marcus 
floored Ernest. Cameron kicked Clinton to the 
other end of the cabin; and Stewart shouted so 
loud for them to be quiet that he made the greatest 
noise of any. </p>

<p>But suddenly they were all silenced by a fierce 
flash of lightning and a loud peal of thunder. The 
wind rose and the planks of our ship cracked. 
Another flash of lightning, brighter and more terrible 
than the first, split our mainmast and carried away 
our foretop-sail; and now the flashes of lightning 
grew terrific and the thunder roared tremendously. 
The rain poured down in torrents, and the gusts of 
wind were most loud and terrible. The hearts of 
the stoutest men in our company now quailed, and 
even the chief doctor was afraid. </p>

<p>At last the storm ceased, but we found it had 
driven us-quite out of our course, and we knew not 
where we were. </p>

<p>On the 30th, Gustavus Dumally who was on deck 
cried out: ‘<span class="smcap">Land</span>!’ </p>

<p>At this we were all extremely rejoiced. On the 
31st we reached it, and found it was the island of 
Trinidad. </p>

<p>We refitted our ship and got in a store of provisions and 
water, and set sail once more on the 5th of 
May. It would be endless to describe all our adventures 
in the South Atlantic Ocean. Suffice it 
to say that after many storms, in which we were 
driven quite out of our course and knew not 
in what part of the world we were, we at last 
discovered land. </p>

<p>We sailed along the coast for some time to find a 
good landing-place. We at last found one. </p>

<p>We landed on the 2nd of June 1793. We moored 
our battered ship in a small harbour and advanced 
up into the country. To our great surprise we 
found it cultivated. Grain of a peculiar sort grew 
in great abundance, and there were large plantations 
of palm-trees, and likewise an immense number of 
almond-trees. There were also many olives and 
large enclosures of rice. </p>

<p>We were greatly surprised at these marks of the 
land being inhabited. It seemed to be part of an 
immense continent. </p>

<p>After we had travelled about two miles we saw at 
a distance twenty men well armed. We immediately prepared 
for battle, having each of us a pistol, 
sword, and bayonet. We stood still and they came 
near. They seemed greatly surprised at us, and we 
heard one of them say: ‘What strange people!’ </p>

<p>The Chief then said: ‘Who are you?’ </p>

<p>Wellesley answered: ‘We were cast up on your 
shores by a storm and require shelter.’ </p>

<p>They said: ‘You shall not have any.’ </p>

<p>‘We will take it, then!’ </p>

<p>We prepared for battle; they did the same. </p>

<p>It was a very fierce encounter, but we conquered: 
killed ten, took the Chief prisoner, wounded five, 
and the remaining four retreated.’ </p>

<p>The Chief was quite black and very tall; he had 
a fine countenance and the finest eyes I ever saw. 
We asked him what his name was, but he would 
not speak. We asked him the name of his country, 
and he said: ‘Ashantee.’ </p>

<p>Next morning a party of twelve men came to our 
tents bringing with them a ransom for their Chief, 
and likewise a proposition of peace from their 
King. This we accepted, as it was on terms most 
advantageous to ourselves. </p>

<p>Immediately after the treaty of peace was concluded we set 
about building a city. The situation 
was in the middle of a large plain, bounded on 
the north by high mountains, on the south by the 
sea, on the east by gloomy forests, and on the 
west by evil deserts. </p>

<p>About a month after we had begun our city the 
following adventure happened to us:— </p>

<p>One evening when all were assembled in the great 
tent, and most of us sitting round the fire which 
blazed in the middle, listening to the storm which 
raged without, a dead silence prevailed. None of 
us felt inclined to speak, still less to laugh, and 
the wine-cups stood upon the round table filled to 
the brim. In the midst of this silence we heard 
the sound of a trumpet which seemed to come from 
the desert. The next moment a peal of thunder 
rolled through the sky, which seemed to shake the 
earth to its centre. </p>

<p>By this time we were all on our legs, and filled 
with terror, which was changed to desperation by 
another blast of the terrible trumpet. We all 
rushed out of the tent with a shout, not of courage, 
but fear; and then we saw a sight so terribly grand 
that even now when I think of it, at the distance 
of forty years from that dismal night, my limbs 
tremble and my blood is chilled with fear. High 
up in the clouds was a tall and terrible giant. In 
his right hand he held a trumpet; in his left two 
darts pointed with fire. On a thunder cloud 
which rolled before him his shield rested. On his 
forehead was written: ‘The Genius of the Storm.’ 
On he strode over the black clouds which rolled 
beneath his feet and regardless of the fierce lightning 
which flashed around him.</p> 

<p>The hoarse voice of the storm was hushed, and a 
gentler light than the fire of the elements spread 
itself over the face of the now cloudless sky. The 
calm moon shone forth in the midst of the firmament, and 
the little stars seemed rejoicing in their 
brightness. The giant had descended to the earth, 
and approaching the place where we stood trembling 
he made three circles in the air with his flaming 
scimitar, and then lifted his hand to strike. Just 
then we heard a loud voice saying: ‘Genius, I 
command thee to forbear!’ </p>

<p>We looked round and saw a figure so tall that the 
Genius seemed to be but a diminutive dwarf. It 
cast one joyful glance on us and disappeared. </p>

<h3>CHAPTER III <br>

<small>THE DESERT </small></h3>

<p>The building of our city went on prosperously. 
The Hall of Justice was finished, the fortifications 
were completed, the Grand Inn was begun, the Great 
Tower was ended. </p>

<p>One night when we were assembled in the Hall of 
Justice, Arthur Wellesley, at that time a common 
trumpeter, suddenly exclaimed, while we were 
talking of our happiness: </p>

<p>‘Does not the King of the Blacks view our 
prosperity with other eyes than ours? Would not 
the best way be to send immediately to England, 
tell them of the new world we have discovered and 
of the riches that are in it; and do you not think 
they would send us an army?’ </p>

<p>Francis Stewart immediately rose and said: 
‘Young man, think before you speak! How could 
we send to England? Who would be found hardy 
enough to traverse again the Atlantic? Do you not 
remember the storm which drove us on the shores of 
Trinidad?’ </p>

<p>Arthur Wellesley answered: ‘It is with all due 
deference that I venture to contradict the opinions 
of older and more experienced men than I am; and 
it is after much consideration that I have ventured 
to say what I have said. Well do I remember that 
storm which forced us to seek refuge amongst 
foreigners. I am not so rash as to suppose that we 
of ourselves could cross the ocean on the damaged 
and leaky vessel we possess, or that we could build 
another in time to avert the danger which I fear is 
coming. But in what a short time have we built 
the city we are now in! How long has it taken to 
rear the Grand Hall where we now are? Have not 
those marble pillars and that solemn dome been 
built by supernatural power? If you view the city 
from this Gothic window and see the beams of the 
morn gilding the battlements of the mighty towers, 
and the pillars of the splendid palaces which have 
been reared in a few months, can you doubt that 
magic has been used in their construction?’ </p>

<p>Here he paused. We were all convinced that the 
genii had helped us to build our town. He went on: </p>

<p>‘Now, if the genii have built us our city, will they 
not likewise help us to call our countrymen to defend 
what they have built against the assaults of the 
enemy?’ </p>

<p>He stopped again, for the roof shook and the hall 
was filled with smoke. The ground opened, and we 
heard a voice saying: </p>

<p>‘When the sun appears above the forests of the 
east be ye all on the border of the evil desert, for if 
ye fail I will crush you to atoms.’ </p>

<p>The voice ceased, the ground closed, and the 
smoke cleared away. There was no time for us to 
consult; the desert lay ten miles off, and it was now 
midnight. We immediately set off with the Duke 
of York at our head. We reached the desert about 
4 A.M., and there we stopped. Far off to the east 
the long black line of gloomy forests skirted the 
horizon. To the north the Mountains of the Moon 
seemed a misty girdle to the plain of Dahomey; to 
the south the ocean guarded the coasts of Africa; 
before us to the west lay the desert. </p>

<p>In a few minutes we saw a dense vapour rise from 
the sands, which gradually collecting took the form 
of a Genius larger than any of the giants. It 
advanced towards us and cried with a loud voice: 
‘Follow me!’ </p>

<p>We obeyed and entered the desert. </p>

<p>After we had travelled a long time, about noon 
the Genius told us to look around. We were now 
about the middle of the desert. Nothing was to be 
seen far or near but vast plains of sand under a 
burning sun and cloudless sky. We were dreadfully 
fatigued and begged the Genius to allow us to stop a 
little, but he immediately ordered us to proceed. 
We therefore began our march again and travelled 
a long way, till the sun went down and the pale 
moon was rising in the east. Also a few stars might 
now be dimly seen, but still the sands were burning 
hot, and our feet were very much swollen. </p>

<p>At last the Genius ordered us to halt and lie down. 
We soon fell asleep. We had slept about an hour 
when the Genius awoke us and ordered us to proceed. </p>

<p>The moon had now risen and shone brightly in the 
midst of the sky—brighter far than it ever does in 
our country. The night-wind had somewhat cooled 
the sands of the desert, so that we walked with more 
ease than before; but now a mist arose which 
covered the whole plain. Through it we thought we 
could discern a dim light. We now likewise heard 
sounds of music at a great distance. </p>

<p>As the mist cleared away the light grew more 
distinct till it burst upon us in almost insufferable 
splendour. Out of the barren desert arose a palace 
of diamonds, the pillars of which were ruby and 
emerald illuminated with lamps too bright to look 
upon. The Genius led us into a hall of sapphire in 
which were thrones of gold. On the thrones sat 
the Princes of the Genii. In the midst of the hall 
hung a lamp like the sun. Around it stood genii 
and fairies whose robes were of beaten gold sparkling 
with diamonds. As soon as their chiefs saw us they 
sprang up from their thrones, one of them seizing 
Arthur Wellesley and exclaiming: ‘This is the Duke 
of Wellington!’ </p>

<p>Arthur Wellesley asked her why she called him 
the Duke of Wellington. </p>

<p>The Genius answered: ‘A prince will arise who 
shall be as a thorn in the side of England, and the 
desolator of Europe. Terrible shall be the struggle 
between that chieftain and you! It will last many 
years, and the conqueror shall gain eternal honour 
and glory. So likewise shall the vanquished; and 
though he shall die in exile his name shall never be 
remembered by his countrymen but with feelings of 
enthusiasm. The renown of the victory shall reach 
the ends of the earth; Kings and Emperors shall 
honour him; Europe shall rejoice in its deliverer; 
and though in his lifetime fools will envy him, he 
shall overcome. At his death renown shall cover 
him, and his name shall be everlasting!’ </p>

<p>When the Genius finished speaking we heard the 
sound of music far off, which drew nearer and nearer 
till it seemed within the hall. Then all the fairies 
and genii joined in one grand chorus which rose 
rolling to the mighty dome and pillars of the genii 
palace, and reached among the vaults and dungeons 
beneath; then gradually dying away it at last 
ceased entirely. </p>

<p>As the music went off the palace slowly disappeared, and 
we found ourselves alone in the midst 
of the desert. The sun had just begun to enlighten 
the world, and the moon might be dimly seen; but 
all below there was sand as far as our eyes could 
reach. We knew not which way to go, and we were 
ready to faint with hunger; but on once more looking round 
we saw lying on the sands some dates and 
palm-wine. Of this we made our breakfast, and 
then began again to think of our journey, when 
suddenly there appeared a beaten track in the 
desert, which we followed. </p>

<p>About noon, when the sun was at its meridian, 
and we felt weary and faint with the heat, a grove 
of palm-trees appeared in sight towards which we 
ran; and after we had rested awhile under its shade, 
and refreshed ourselves with its fruit, we resumed 
our march; and that same night to our inexpressible 
joy we entered the gates of our beautiful city and 
slept beneath the shadow of its roofs. </p>




<h3>CHAPTER IV <br>

<small>NEWS FROM HOME </small></h3>

<p>The next morning we were awakened by the sound 
of trumpets and great war-drums, and on looking 
towards the mountains we saw descending to the 
plain an immense army of Ashantees. We were all 
thrown into the utmost consternation except Arthur 
Wellesley, who advised us to look to the great guns 
and man the walls, never doubting that genii would 
come to our help if we ourselves could not beat them 
off by the help of the cannon and rockets. </p>

<p>This advice we immediately followed, while the 
Ashantees came on like a torrent, sweeping everything, burning 
the palm-trees, and laying waste the 
rice-fields. </p>

<p>When they came up to the walls of our city they 
set up a terrible yell, the meaning of which was that 
we should be consumed from the face of the earth, 
and that our city should vanish away; for as it came 
by magic it should go by the same. Our answer to 
this insolent speech was a peal of thunder from the 
mouth of our cannon. Two fell dead, and the rest 
set off towards the mountains with amazing swiftness, followed 
by a triumphant shout from their 
conquerors. </p>

<p>They came back in the afternoon and in the most 
submissive terms asked for their dead. We granted 
their request, and in return they allowed us to 
witness the funeral. </p>

<p>A few days after, on the 21st of September, 
Ronald, running into the Halls of Justice where we 
all were, shouted out that there was a ship from 
England. The Duke of York immediately sent 
Arthur Wellesley to ascertain the truth of this. </p>

<p>When he arrived at the seashore he found all the 
crew, consisting of fifty men, had landed. He then 
examined the state of the ship, and found it was 
almost a complete wreck. He asked the men a few 
questions and they seemed greatly surprised to find 
him here, and asked him how he contrived to live 
in such a country. He told them to follow him. </p>

<p>When he brought them to the Halls of Justice, 
the Duke of York asked them to relate their story. 
They cried: ‘We were driven on your shore by 
a storm, and we request shelter.’ </p>

<p>The Duke of York answered: ‘Fellow-Englishmen, 
we rejoice that you were driven on our part of the 
coast, and you shall have shelter if we can give it.’ </p>

<p>Accordingly they remained with us about a fortnight, for 
at the end of that time the genii had fitted 
out their ship again, when they set sail for England 
accompanied by Arthur Wellesley. </p>

<p>For about ten years after this we remained at war 
with the blacks, and then made peace; after which, 
for about ten years more, nothing happened worth 
mentioning. </p>

<p>On the 16th of May 1816, a voice passed through 
the city saying: ‘Set a watch on the tower which 
looks towards the south, for to-morrow a conqueror 
shall enter your gates!’ </p>

<p>The Duke of York immediately despatched Henry 
Clinton to the highest tower in the city. About 
noon Clinton cried out: </p>

<p>‘I see something at a great distance upon the 
Atlantic.’ </p>

<p>We all of us ran to the watch-tower, and on looking 
towards the ocean we could discern a dark object 
upon the verge of the horizon which as it neared 
the shore we saw plainly was a fleet. At last it 
anchored and the men began to land. </p>

<p>First came seventy-two regiments of horsemen, 
next, three of infantry, then several high officers. 
The latter seemed to be the staff of some great 
general; and last of all came the general himself, 
who had the bearing of Arthur Wellesley. </p>

<p>After he had marshalled the regiments he ordered 
them to march, and we saw them enter the gates of 
the city. When they arrived at the tower they 
stopped, and we heard the general say: </p>

<p>‘Hill, you may stop here with the army while I 
go to the Palace of Justice, as I suppose they are 
all there if they be yet in the land of the living. 
And, Beresford, you must come with me.’ </p>

<p>‘No, no, we are here, Arthur, almost terrified 
out of our wits for fear you shall burn the tower 
and sack the city!’ exclaimed the Duke of York as 
we descended from our hiding-place. </p>

<p>‘What! Are you all here, and not one of you 
slain in battle or dead in the hospital?’ said His 
Grace as he sprang from his war-horse and we shook 
hands with him two at a time. ‘But come, my 
brave fellows, let us go to the Grand Inn, and in 
Fernando Hall we will talk of what we have done 
and suffered since we last met.’ </p>

<p>‘Please, your Grace, in what part of the town is 
the army to be quartered?’ said one of the staff. </p>

<p>‘Oh, never you fear for the army, Murry; we are 
not amongst Spaniards. Let them follow me.’ </p>

<p>‘The army is to follow His Grace the Duke of 
Wellington,’ said Murry. </p>

<p>‘His Grace the Duke of Wellington!’ we all 
exclaimed at once in great surprise. </p>

<p>‘Yes,—His Grace the Duke of Wellington,’ said 
another of the staff. ‘I don’t know who you are, 
but he is one of the most noble generals, the conqueror 
of Bonaparte and the deliverer of Europe.’ </p>

<p>‘Then the genii don’t always tell lies,’ said 
Marcus; ‘and I’m very glad of it, for I always 
thought, Duke, you would return to us with more 
glory than you had when you went away from us.’ </p>

<p>By this time we had arrived at the Grand Inn, 
which was a most superior building and large enough 
to accommodate twenty thousand men. We were 
soon seated in the hall and listening to Beresford as 
he related to us how Europe had been set free from 
the iron chain of a despot, and how the mighty 
victory had been achieved with which all the civilised world 
had rung; of the splendid triumphs 
which had taken place on that glorious occasion; 
and how all the high sovereigns of Europe had 
honoured England with their presence on that grand 
occasion. Longer could we have listened and more 
could he have told had we not heard the sound of 
the midnight bell which reminded us that it was 
time to retire to rest. </p>

<p>Some days after this the Duke of York expressed 
a wish to return to his own country, and one of the 
ships with about twenty men was appointed to 
convey him there. </p>

<p>There were now in the city fifteen thousand men, 
and we determined to elect a King. Accordingly a 
council of the whole nation was summoned for the 
14th of June 1816. On that day they all assembled 
in the Palace of Justice. Around the throne sat 
Marcus O’Donell, Ferdinand Cortez, Henry Clinton, 
Gustavus Dumally, Harold FitzGeorge, and the 
Duke of Wellington and his staff. </p>

<p>An intense anxiety pervaded the council to know 
who would be proposed as King, for not a man of us 
knew, and no hints had been thrown out. At length 
the great entrance was closed, and Cortez proclaimed 
the whole nation to be present. Stewart then rose 
and said: </p>

<p>‘I propose the most noble Field-Marshal Arthur, 
Duke of Wellington, as a fit and proper person to sit 
on the throne of these realms.’ </p>

<p>Immediately a loud shout burst forth from the 
multitude, and the hall rang: ‘Long live our most 
noble Duke of Wellington!’ and almost immediately 
afterwards a profound silence prevailed in the house. 
He said: ‘Fellow-soldiers, I will defend what you 
have committed to my care.’ </p>

<p>Then, bowing to the council, he retired amidst 
thundering sounds of enthusiastic joy. </p>

<p class="title">AN ADVENTURE IN IRELAND </p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">During</span> my travels in the south of Ireland the 
following adventure happened to me. One evening in the month 
of August, after a long walk, I 
was ascending the mountain which overlooks the 
village of Cahin, when I suddenly came in sight of 
a fine old castle. It was built upon a rock, and 
behind it was a large wood, and before it was a 
river. Over the river there was a bridge, which 
formed the approach to the castle. </p>

<p>When I arrived at the bridge I stood still awhile 
to enjoy the prospect around me: far below was the 
wide sheet of still water in which the reflection of 
the pale moon was not disturbed by the smallest 
wave; in the valley was the cluster of cabins which 
is known by the appellation of Cahin; and beyond 
these were the mountains of Killala. Over all, the 
grey robe of twilight was now stealing with silent 
and scarcely perceptible advances. No sound except 
the hum of the distant village and the sweet song 
of the nightingales in the wood behind me broke 
upon the stillness of the scene. </p>

<p>While I was contemplating this beautiful prospect 
a gentleman, whom I had not before observed, 
accosted me with ‘Good evening, sir; are you a 
stranger in these parts?’ </p>

<p>I replied that I was. He then asked me where I 
was going to stop for the night; I answered that I 
intended to sleep somewhere in the village. </p>

<p>‘I am afraid you will find very bad accommodation there,’ 
said the gentleman; ‘but if you 
will take up your quarters with me at the castle, 
you are welcome.’ </p>

<p>I thanked him for his kind offer, and accepted it. </p>

<p>When we arrived at the castle I was shown into 
a large parlour, in which was an old lady sitting in 
an armchair by the fireside, knitting. On the rug 
lay a very pretty tortoiseshell cat. As soon as mentioned, 
the old lady rose; and when Mr. O’Callaghan 
(for that, I learned, was his name) told her who I 
was, she said in the most cordial tone that I was 
welcome, and asked me to sit down. </p>

<p>In the course of conversation I learned that she 
was Mr. O’Callaghan’s mother, and that his father 
had been dead about a year. </p>

<p>We had sat about an hour, when supper was 
announced, and after supper Mr. O’Callaghan asked 
me if I should like to retire for the night. I 
answered in the affirmative, and a little boy was 
commissioned to show me to my apartment. It 
was a snug, clean, and comfortable little old-fashioned 
room at the top of the castle. As soon as 
we had entered, the boy, who appeared to be a 
shrewd, good-tempered little fellow, said with a 
shrug of the shoulder: ‘If it was going to bed I 
was, it shouldn’t be here that you’d catch me.’ </p>

<p>‘Why?’ said I. </p>

<p>‘Because,’ replied the boy, ‘they say that the 
ould masther’s ghost has been seen sitting on that 
there chair.’ </p>

<p>‘And have you seen him?’ </p>

<p>‘No; but I’ve heard him washing his hands in 
that basin often and often.’ </p>

<p>‘What is your name, my little fellow?’ </p>

<p>‘Dennis Mulready, please, your honour.’ </p>

<p>‘Well, good night to you.’ </p>

<p>‘Good night, masther; and may the saints keep 
you from all fairies and brownies,’ said Dennis as he 
left the room. </p>

<p>As soon as I had laid down I began to think of 
what the boy had been telling me, and I confess I 
felt a strange kind of fear, and once or twice I even 
thought I could discern something white through 
the darkness which surrounded me. At length, by 
the help of reason, I succeeded in mastering these, 
what some would call idle fancies, and fell asleep. </p>

<p>I had slept about an hour when a strange sound 
awoke me, and I saw looking through my curtains 
a skeleton wrapped in a white sheet. I was overcome with 
terror and tried to scream, but my tongue 
was paralysed and my whole frame shook with fear. 
In a deep hollow voice it said to me: </p>

<p>‘Arise, that I may show thee this world’s wonders,’ and 
in an instant I found myself encompassed 
with clouds and darkness. But soon the roar of 
mighty waters fell upon my ear, and I saw some 
clouds of spray arising from high falls that rolled 
in awful majesty down tremendous precipices, and 
then foamed and thundered in the gulf beneath as 
if they had taken up their unquiet abode in some 
giant’s cauldron. </p>

<p>But soon the scene changed, and I found myself 
in the mines of Cracone. There were high pillars 
and stately arches, whose glittering splendour was 
never excelled by the brightest fairy palaces. There 
were not many lamps; only those of a few poor 
miners, whose rough visages formed a striking contrast to 
the dazzling figures and grandeur which 
surrounded them. But in the midst of all this 
magnificence I felt an indescribable sense of fear 
and terror; for the sea raged above us, and by the 
awful and tumultuous noises of roaring winds and 
dashing waves it seemed as if the storm was violent. 
And now the mossy pillars groaned beneath the 
pressure of the ocean, and the glittering arches 
seemed about to be overwhelmed. When I heard 
the rushing waters and saw a mighty flood rolling 
towards me I gave a loud shriek of terror. </p>

<p>The scene vanished and I found myself in a wide 
desert full of barren rocks and high mountains. As 
I was approaching one of the rocks, in which there 
was a large cave, my foot stumbled and I fell. Just 
then I heard a deep growl, and saw by the unearthly 
light of his own fiery eyes a royal lion rousing himself 
from his kingly slumbers. His terrible eye was 
fixed upon me, and the desert rang and the rocks 
echoed with the tremendous roar of fierce delight 
which he uttered as he sprang towards me. </p>

<p>‘Well, masther, it’s been a windy night, though 
it’s fine now,’ said Dennis, as he drew the window 
curtain and let the bright rays of the morning sun 
into the little old-fashioned room at the top of 
O’Callaghan Castle. </p>

<h3>CHAPTER I <br>

<small>CHARACTER OF O’DONELL—CAUSE OF HIS TRAVELS </small></h3>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">Not</span> many years ago there lived in a certain city a 
person of the name of Henry O’Donell. In figure 
he was tall, of a dark complexion, and searching 
black eye. His mind was strong and unbending, 
his disposition unsociable, and though respected by 
many he was loved by few. </p>

<p>The city where he resided was very great and 
magnificent. It was governed by a warrior, a 
mighty man of valour, whose deeds had resounded 
to the ends of the earth. </p>

<p>This soldier had two sons, who were at that time 
of the separate ages of six and seven years. </p>

<p>Henry O’Donell was a nobleman of great consequence in the 
city, and a peculiar favourite with the 
governor, before whose glance his stern mind would 
bow; and at his command O’Donell’s self-will 
would be overcome. </p>

<p>While playing with the young princes he would 
forget his usual sullenness of demeanour, the days 
of his childhood returned upon him, and he would 
be as merry as the youngest, who was gay indeed. </p>

<p>One day, at Court, a quarrel ensued between him 
and another noble. Words came to blows, and 
O’Donell struck his opponent a violent blow on the 
left cheek. At this the military King started up and 
commanded O’Donell to apologise. This he immediately did, 
but from that hour of dissent a spell 
seemed to have been cast over him, and he resolved 
to quit the city. </p>

<p>The evening before he put this resolution into 
practice he had an interview with the King, and 
returned quite an altered man. Before, he seemed 
stern and intractable; now, he was only meditative 
and sorrowful. As he was passing the inner court of 
the palace he perceived the two young princes at play. 
He called them, and they came running to him. </p>

<p>‘I am going far from this city, and shall, most 
likely, never see you again,’ said O’Donell. </p>

<p>‘Where are you going?’ </p>

<p>‘I cannot tell.’ </p>

<p>‘Then why do you go away from us? Why do 
you go from your own house and lands, from this 
great and splendid city, to you know not where?’ </p>

<p>‘Because I am not happy here.’ </p>

<p>‘And if you are not happy here, where you have 
everything for which you can wish, do you expect 
to be happy when you are dying of hunger or thirst 
in a desert, or longing for the society of men when 
you are thousands of miles from any human being?’ </p>

<p>‘How do you know that that will be my case?’ </p>

<p>‘It is very likely that it will.’ </p>

<p>‘And if it is I am determined to go.’ </p>

<p>‘Take this then, that you may sometimes remember us when 
you dwell with only the wild beasts of 
the desert, or the great eagle of the mountain,’ said 
they, as they each gave him a curling lock of their hair. </p>

<p>‘Yes, I will take it, my princes, and I shall remember 
you, and the mighty warrior King, your father, 
even when the Angel of Death has stretched forth 
his bony arm against me, and I am within the confines of 
his dreary kingdom, the cold, damp grave,’ 
replied O’Donell, as the tears rushed to his eyes; 
and he once more embraced the little princes, and 
then quitted them, it might be, for ever. </p>

<h3>CHAPTER II <br>

<small>ABOUT MEETING DELANCY—COMING TO THE OLD 
CASTLE—ENTERING THE NEW WORLD—DESCRIPTION </small></h3>

<p>The dawn of the next morning found O’Donell on 
the summit of a high mountain which overlooked 
the city. He had stopped to take a farewell view 
of the place of his nativity. All along the eastern 
horizon there was a rich glowing light, which, as it 
rose, gradually melted into the pale blue of the sky, 
in which, just over the light, there was still visible 
the silver crescent of the moon. Ina short time the 
sun began to rise in golden glory, casting his splendid 
radiance over all the face of nature, and illuminating 
the magnificent city; in the midst of which, towering in 
silent grandeur, there appeared the palace 
where dwelt the mighty Prince of that great and 
beautiful city, all around the brazen gates and 
massive walls of which there flowed the majestic 
stream of the Guadima, whose banks were bordered 
by splendid palaces and magnificent gardens. 
Behind these, stretching for many a league, were 
fruitful plains and forests, whose shade seemed 
almost impenetrable to a single ray of light; while 
in the distance blue mountains were seen raising 
their heads to the sky and forming a misty girdle 
to the plains of Dahomey. On the whole of this grand 
and beautiful prospect O’Donell’s gaze was long and 
fixed; but his last look was to the palace of the King, 
and a tear stood in his eye as he said earnestly: </p>

<p>‘May he be preserved from all evil! May good 
attend him; and may the chief genii spread their 
broad shield of protection over him all the time of 
his sojourn in this wearisome world!’ </p>

<p>Then, turning round, he began to descend the 
mountain. He pursued his way till the sun began 
to wax hot; when he stopped, and, sitting down, he 
took out some provisions which he had brought with 
him, and which consisted of a few biscuits and dates. </p>

<p>While he was eating, a tall man came up and 
accosted him. O’Donell requested him to sit beside 
him, and offered him a biscuit. This he refused, 
and, taking one out of a small bag which he carried, 
he sat down, and they began to talk. In the course 
of conversation, O’Donell: learned that this man’s 
name was Alexander Delancy, that he was a native 
of France, and that he was engaged in the same 
pursuit with himself, <i>i.e.</i> the search of happiness. 
They talked for a long time, and, at last, agreed to 
travel together. Then, rising, they pursued their 
journey. </p>

<p>Towards nightfall they lay down in the open air, 
and slept soundly till morning, when they again set 
off; and thus they continued till the third day, 
when, about two hours after noon, they approached 
an old castle, which they entered; and, as they 
were examining it, they discovered a subterraneous 
passage which they could not see the end of. </p>

<p>‘Let us follow where this passage leads us, and, 
perhaps, we may find happiness here,’ said O’Donell. </p>

<p>Delancy agreed, and the two stepped into the 
opening. Immediately a great stone was rolled to 
the mouth of the passage, with a noise like thunder, 
which shut out all but a single ray of daylight. </p>

<p>‘What is that?’ exclaimed O’Donell. </p>

<p>‘I cannot tell,’ replied Delancy; ‘but, never mind, 
I suppose it is only some Genius playing tricks.’ </p>

<p>‘Well, it may be so,’ returned O’Donell; and 
they proceeded on their way. </p>

<p>After travelling for a long time—as near as they 
could reckon about two days—they perceived a 
silvery streak of light on the walls of the passage, 
something like the light of the moon. In a short 
time they came to the end of the passage, and, 
leaping out of the opening which formed, they 
entered a new world. </p>

<p>They were, at first, so much bewildered by the 
different objects which struck their senses that they 
almost fainted; but, at length recovering, they had 
time to see everything around them. They were 
upon the top of a rock which was more than a 
thousand fathoms high. All beneath them were 
liquid mountains tossed to and fro with horrible 
confusion, roaring and raging with a tremendous 
noise, and crowned with waves of foam. All above 
them was a mighty firmament, in one part covered 
with black clouds from which darted: huge and 
terrible sheets of lightning. In another part an 
immense globe of light, like silver, was hanging in 
the sky; and several smaller globes, which sparkled 
exceedingly, surrounded it. </p>

<p>In a short time, the tempest, which was dreadful 
beyond description, ceased; the dark, black clouds 
cleared away; the silver globes vanished, and 
another globe, whose light was of a gold colour, 
appeared. It was far larger than the former, and, 
in a little time, it became so intensely bright, that 
they could no longer gaze on it; so, after looking 
around them for some time, they rose and pursued 
their journey. </p>

<p>They had travelled a long way when they came to 
an immense forest, the trees of which bore a large 
fruit of a deep purple colour, of which they tasted 
and found that it was fit for food. They journeyed 
in this forest for three days, and on the third day 
they entered a valley, or rather a deep glen, surrounded 
on each side by tremendous rocks whose 
tops were lost in the clouds. In this glen they continued 
for some time, and at last came in sight of 
a mountain which rose so high that they could not 
see the summit, though the sky was quite clear. 
At the foot of the mountain there flowed a river of 
pure water, bordered by trees which had flowers of 
a beautiful rose colour. Except these trees nothing 
was to be seen but black forests and huge rocks 
rising out of a wilderness which bore the terrible 
aspect of devastation, and which stretched as far as 
the eye could reach. In this desolate land no sound 
was to be heard, not even the cry of the eagle or the 
scream of the curlew; but a silence like the silence 
of the grave reigned over all the face of nature, 
unbroken except by the murmur of the river as it 
slowly wound its course through the desert. </p>

<h3>CHAPTER III <br>

<small>COMING TO THE CAVE—MANNER OF 
LIFE—ARRIVAL OF THE OLD MAN </small></h3>

<p>After they had contemplated this scene for some 
time, O’Donell exclaimed: ‘Alexander, let us abide 
here. What need have we to travel farther? Let 
us make this our place of rest.’ </p>

<p>‘We will,’ replied Delancy. ‘And this shall be 
our abode,’ added he, pointing to a cave at the foot 
of the mountains. </p>

<p>‘It shall,’ returned O’Donell, as they entered it. </p>

<p>In this country they remained for many long 
years, and passed their time in a manner which 
made them completely happy. Sometimes they 
would sit upon a high rock, and listen to the hoarse 
thunder rolling through the sky and making the 
mountains to echo and the desert to ring with its 
awful voice. Sometimes they would watch the 
lightning darting across black clouds and shivering 
huge fragments of rock in its terrible passage. 
Sometimes they would witness the great, glorious 
orb of gold sink behind the far distant mountains 
which girded the horizon, and then watch the 
advance of grey twilight, and the little stars coming 
forth in beauty, and the silver moon rising in her 
splendour, till the cold dews of night began to fall; 
and then they would retire to their beds in the cave 
with hearts full of joy and thankfulness. </p>

<p>One evening they were seated in this cave by a 
large blazing fire of turf which cast its lurid light to 
the high arched roof and illuminated the tall and 
stately pillars, cut by the hand of nature out of the 
stony rock, with a cheerful red glare that appeared 
strange in this desolate land, which no fires had ever 
before visited, except those fierce flames of death 
which flash from the heavens when robed in the 
dreadful majesty of thunder. They were seated in 
this cave then, listening to the howling night-wind 
as it swept in mournful cadences through the trees 
of the forest which encircled the foot of the mountain and 
bordered the stream which flowed round 
it. They were quite silent, and their thoughts were 
occupied by those that were afar off, and whom it 
was their fate most likely never more to behold. </p>

<p>O’Donell was thinking of his noble master and 
his young princes; of the thousands of miles which 
intervened between him and them; and the sad, 
silent tear gushed forth as he ruminated on the 
happiness of those times, when his master frowned 
not, when the gloom of care gave place to the smile 
of friendship, when he would talk to him and laugh 
with him, and be to him, not as a brother,—no, no, 
but as a mighty warrior, who, relaxing from his 
haughtiness, would now and then converse with his 
high officers in a strain of vivacity and playful 
humour not to be equalled. Next he viewed him in 
his mind’s eye at the head of his army. He heard, 
in the ears of his imagination, the buzz of expectation, 
of hope, and supposition which hummed round 
him as his penetrating eye, with a still keenness of 
expression, was fixed on the distant ranks of the 
enemy. Then he heard his authoritative voice 
exclaim: ‘Onward, brave sons of freedom! 
Onward to the battle!’ And, lastly, his parting 
words to him: ‘In prosperity or in misery, in 
sorrow or in joy, in populous cities or in desolate 
wildernesses, my prayer shall go with you!’ darted 
across his mind with such painful distinctness, that 
he at length gave way to his uncontrollable grief at 
the thought that he should never behold his beloved 
and mighty commander more; and burst into a 
flood of tears. </p>

<p>‘What is the matter, Henry?’ exclaimed Delancy. </p>

<p>‘Oh, nothing, nothing,’ was the reply; and they 
were resuming their tacit thinking, when a voice 
was heard outside the cavern, which broke strangely 
upon the desolate silence and that land which for 
thousands of years had heard no sound save the 
howling of the wind through the forest, the echoing 
of the thunder among mountains, or the solitary 
murmuring of the river; if we except the presence 
of O’Donell and Delancy. </p>

<p>‘Listen!’ cried Alexander; ‘listen! What is that?’ </p>

<p>‘It is the sound of a man’s voice,’ replied Henry; 
and then snatching up a burning torch he rushed to 
the mouth of the cave, followed by Delancy. When 
they had got there they saw the figure of a very old 
man sitting on the damp, wet ground, moaning and 
complaining bitterly. They went up to him. At 
their approach he rose and said: </p>

<p>‘Are you human or supernatural beings?’ </p>

<p>They assured him that they were human. He 
went on: </p>

<p>‘Then why have you taken up your abode in this 
land of the grave?’ </p>

<p>O’Donell answered that he would relate to him all 
the particulars if he would take shelter for the night 
with them. The old man consented, and when they 
were all assembled round the cheerful fire, O’Donell 
fulfilled his promise; and then requested the old 
man to tell them how he came to be travelling there. 
He complied, and began as follows:— </p>

<h3>CHAPTER IV <br>

<small>OLD MAN’S TALE </small></h3>

<p>I was the son of a respectable merchant in 
Moussoul. My father intended to bring me up to 
his own trade, but I was idle and did not like it. 
One day, as I was playing in the street, a very old 
man came up to me and asked me if I would go with 
him. I asked him where he was going. He replied 
that if I would go with him he would show me very 
wonderful things. This raised my curiosity and I 
consented. He immediately took me by the hand 
and hurried me out of the city of Moussoul so 
quickly that my breath was almost stopped, and it 
seemed as if we glided along in the air, for I could 
hear no sound of any footsteps. We continued on 
our course for a long time, till we came to a glen 
surrounded by very high mountains. How we 
passed over these mountains I could never tell. In 
the middle of the glen there was a small fountain of 
very clear water. My conductor directed me to 
drink of it. This I did and immediately I found 
myself in a palace, the glory of which far exceeds any 
description which I can give. The tall, stately 
pillars, reaching from heaven to earth, were formed 
of the finest, purest diamonds; the pavement 
sparkling with gold and precious stones; and the 
mighty dome, made solemn and awful by its 
stupendous magnitude, was of a single emerald. 
In the midst of this grand and magnificent palace 
was a lamp like the sun, the radiance of which made 
all the palace to flash and glitter with an almost 
fearful grandeur. The ruby sent forth a streak of 
crimson light, the topaz gold, the sapphire intensest 
purple, and the dome poured a flood of deep, clear 
splendour which overcame all the other gaudy 
lights by its mild, triumphant glory. In this palace 
were thousands and tens of thousands of fairies and 
genii, some of whom flitted lightly among the blazing 
lamps to the sound of unearthly music, which died 
and swelled in a stream of wild grandeur, suited to 
the words they sang:— </p>

<p class="poem">In this fairy land of light <br>
    <span>No mortals e’er have been; </span><br>
And the dreadful grandeur of this sight <br>
    <span>By them hath not been seen. </span><br>
It would strike them shuddering to the earth <br>
    <span>Like the flash from a thunder-cloud; </span><br>
It would quench their light and joyous mirth <br>
    <span>And fit them for the shroud. </span><br>
The rising of our palaces <br>
    <span>Like visions of the deep, </span><br>
And the glory of their structure, <br>
    <span>No mortal voice can speak. </span></p>

<p style="text-align:center; font-size:90%"><i>Chorus:</i> </p>

<p class="poem" style="margin-left:40px">    The music of our songs, <br>
        <span>And our mighty trumpet’s swell, </span><br>
    And the sounding of our silver harps, <br>
        <span>No mortal tongue can tell. </span></p>

<p class="poem">Of us they know but little, <br>
    <span>Save when the storm doth rise, </span><br>
And the mighty waves are tossing <br>
    <span>Against the archèd skies. </span><br>
Then oft they see us striding <br>
    <span>O’er the billow’s snow-white foam, </span><br>
Or hear us speak in thunder <br>
    <span>When we stand, in grandeur lone, </span><br>
On the darkest of the mighty clouds <br>
    <span>Which veil the pearly moon, </span><br>
Around us lightning flashing, <br>
    <span>Night’s blackness to illume. </span></p>

<p style="text-align:center; font-size:90%"><i>Chorus:</i> </p>

<p class="poem" style="margin-left:40px">    The music of our songs, <br>
        <span>And our mighty trumpet’s swell, </span><br>
    And the sounding of our silver harps, <br>
        <span>No mortal tongue can tell. </span></p>

<p>When they had finished there was a dead silence 
for about half an hour; and then the palace began 
slowly and gradually to vanish, till it disappeared 
entirely, and I found myself in the glen surrounded 
by high mountains, and the fountain, illuminated 
by the cold light of the moon, springing up in the 
middle of the valley; and standing close by was 
the old man who had conducted me to this enchanted 
place. He turned round and I could see 
that his countenance had an expression of strange 
severity which I had not before observed. </p>

<p>‘Follow me,’ he said. </p>

<p>I obeyed, and we began to ascend the mountain. 
It is needless to trouble you with a repetition of my 
adventures. Suffice it to say that after two months’ 
time we arrived at a large temple. We entered it. 
The interior as well as the outside had a very 
gloomy and ominous aspect, being entirely built of 
black marble. The old man suddenly seized me and 
dragged me to an altar at the upper end of the 
temple; then, forcing me down on my knees, he 
made me swear that I would be his servant for ever. 
This promise I faithfully kept, notwithstanding the 
dreadful scenes of magic of which every day of my 
life I was forced to be a witness. One day he told 
me he would discharge me from the oath I had 
taken, and commanded me to leave his service. I 
obeyed, and, after wandering about the world for 
many years, I, one evening, laid myself down on a 
little bank by the roadside, intending to pass the 
night there. Suddenly, I found myself raised in the 
air by invisible hands. In a short time I lost sight 
of the earth, and continued on my course through 
the clouds till I became insensible; and, when I 
recovered from my swoon, I found myself lying 
outside this cave. What may be my future destiny 
I know not. </p>




<h3>CHAPTER V <br>

<small>DEPARTURE OF THE OLD MAN—DISAPPEARANCE OF 
DELANCY—TRANSPORTATION OF O’DONELL—HIS 
ARRIVAL AT THE CITY—HIS ARRIVAL AT THE 
PALACE, AND HIS INTERVIEW WITH HIS CHIEF—HE 
FINDS DELANCY </small></h3>

<p>When the old man had finished his tale, O’Donell 
and Delancy thanked him for the relation, adding 
at the same time that they had never heard anything half 
so wonderful. Then, as it was very late, 
they all retired to rest. Next morning, O’Donell 
awoke very early, and, looking round the cave, he 
perceived the bed of leaves on which the old man 
had lain to be empty. Then rising he went out of 
the cave. </p>

<p>The sky was covered with red, fiery clouds, 
except those in the east whose edges were tinged 
with the bright rays of the morning sun as they 
strove to hide its glory with their dark veil of 
vapours, now all beauty and radiance by the golden 
lines of light which streaked their gloomy surface 
beneath this storm-portending sky; and, far off, to 
the westward rose two tremendous rocks whose 
summits were enveloped with black clouds rolling 
one above another with an awful magnificence well-suited 
to the land of wilderness and mountain which 
they canopied. </p>

<p>Gliding along in the air between these two rocks 
was a chariot of light. In the chariot sat a figure 
the expression of whose countenance was that of the 
old man, armed with the majesty and might of a 
spirit. </p>

<p>O’Donell stood at the mouth of the cave watching 
it till it vanished, and then, calling Delancy, he 
related the circumstance to him. </p>

<p>Some years after this, Alexander went out one 
morning in search of the fruit on which they subsisted. 
Noon came, and he had not returned; 
evening, and still no tidings of him. O’Donell began 
to be alarmed and set out in search of him, but could 
nowhere find him. One whole day he spent in 
wandering about the rocks and mountains, and in 
the evening he came back to his cave weary and 
faint with hunger and thirst. Days, weeks, months, 
passed away, and no Delancy appeared. O’Donell 
might now be said to be truly miserable. He would 
sit on a rock for hours together and cry out: 
‘Alexander! Alexander!’ but receive no answer but 
the distant echoing of his voice among the rocks. 
Sometimes he fancied it was another person answering him, 
and he would listen earnestly till it died 
away. Then, sinking into utter despair again, he 
would sit till the dews of night began to fall, when he 
would retire to his cave to pass the night in anguish, 
broken slumbers, or in thinking of his beloved 
comrade, whom he could never see more. In one 
of these dreadful intervals he took up a small parcel. 
Opening it, he saw lying before him two locks of 
soft, curly hair, shining like burnished gold. He 
gazed on them for a little time, and thought of the 
words of those who gave them to him: </p>

<p>‘Take this then, that you may remember us when 
you dwell with only the wild beasts of the desert, or 
the great eagle of the mountain.’ </p>

<p>He burst into a flood of tears. He wrung his 
hands in sorrow, and in the anguish of the moment 
he wished that he could once more see them and 
the mighty warrior King, their father, if it cost him 
his life. </p>

<p>Just at that instant a loud clap of thunder shook 
the roof of the cave. A sound like the rushing of 
wind was heard, and a mighty Genius stood before 
him. </p>

<p>‘I know thy wish,’ cried he with a loud and 
terrible voice, ‘and I will grant it. In two months’ 
time thou returnest to the castle, whence thou 
camest hither, and surrenderest thyself into my 
power!’ </p>

<p>O’Donell promised that he would; and instantly 
he found himself at the door of the old castle, and 
in the land of his birth. </p>

<p>He pursued his journey for three days, and on 
the third day he arrived at the mountain which 
overlooked the city. It was a beautiful evening in 
the month of September, and the full moon was 
shedding her tranquil light on all the face of nature. 
The city was lying in its splendour and magnificence 
surrounded by the broad stream of the Guadima. 
The palace was majestically towering in the midst 
of it, and all its pillars and battlements seemed in 
the calm light of the moon as if they were transformed into 
silver by the touch of a fairy’s wand. </p>

<p>O’Donell stayed not long to contemplate this 
beautiful scene, but, descending the mountain, he 
soon crossed the fertile plain which led to the city, 
and, entering the gates, he quickly arrived at the 
palace. Without speaking to any one, he entered 
the inner court of the palace by a secret way with 
which he was acquainted, and then going up a flight 
of steps and crossing a long gallery he arrived at the 
King’s private apartments. The door was half 
open. He looked in and beheld two very handsome 
young men sitting together and reading. He 
instantly recognised them, and was going to step 
forward, when the door opened and the Great 
Duke entered. O’Donell could contain himself 
no longer, and, rushing in, he threw himself at the 
feet of His Grace. </p>

<p>‘O’Donell! is this you?’ exclaimed the Duke. </p>

<p>‘It is, my most noble master!’ answered 
O’Donell, almost choking with joy. The young 
princes instantly embraced him, while he almost 
smothered them with caresses. </p>

<p>After awhile they became tranquil, and then 
O’Donell, at the request of the Duke, related all his 
adventures since he parted with them, not omitting 
the condition on which he was now in the palace. </p>

<p>When he had ended a loud voice was heard saying 
that he was free from his promise and might spend 
the rest of his days in his native city. </p>

<p>Some time after this, as O’Donell was walking in 
the streets, he met a gentleman whom he thought 
he had seen before, but could not recollect where or 
under what circumstances. After a little conversation he 
discovered that he was Alexander Delancy, 
that he was now a rich merchant in the city of Paris, 
and high in favour with the Emperor Napoleon. As 
may be supposed they both were equally delighted 
at the discovery. They ever after lived happily in 
their separate cities; and so ends my little tale. </p>

<h3>CHAPTER I </h3>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">Many</span> years ago there lived in a certain country a 
youth named Ernest Alembert. He came of an 
ancient and noble race: but one of his ancestors 
having been beheaded in consequence of a suspicion 
of high treason, the family since that time had 
gradually decayed, until at length the only remaining branch 
of it was this young man of whom 
I write. </p>

<p>His abode was a small cottage situated in the 
midst of a little garden, and overshadowed by the 
majestic ruins of his ancestral castle. The porch of 
his hut, adorned by the twisting clematis and jessamine, 
fronted the rising sun, and here in the cool 
summer mornings he would often sit and watch its 
broad orb slowly appearing above the blue distant 
mountains. The eminence on which his cottage 
was built formed one side of a wide valley, watered 
by a stream whose hoarse voice was softened into a 
gentle murmur ere it reached the summit of a hill. 
The opposing rocks which guarded the vale on the 
other side were covered by a wood of young ash and 
sycamore trees, whose branching foliage, clothing 
them in a robe of living green, hid their rugged 
aspect, save where some huge fragment, all grey and 
moss-grown, jutted far over the valley, affording a 
fine contrast to the leafy luxuriant branch which 
perhaps rested on the projection, and imparting an 
appearance of picturesque wildness and variety to 
the scene. The valley itself was sprinkled with tall 
shady elms and poplars, that shaded the soft verdant 
turf ornamented by cowslips, violets, daisies, golden 
cups, and a thousand other sweet flowers, which 
shed abroad their perfumes when the morning and 
evening summer dews, or the rains of spring, 
descend softly and silently to the earth. On the 
borders of the stream a few weeping willows stood 
dipping their long branches into the water, where 
their graceful forms were clearly reflected. Through 
an opening in the vale this noisy river was observed 
gradually expanding and smoothing until at last it 
became a wide lake, in calm weather a glassy unruffled mirror 
for all the clouds and stars of heaven 
to behold themselves in as they sailed through the 
spangled or dappled firmament. Beyond this lake 
arose high hills, at noonday almost indistinguishable from 
the blue sky, but at sunset glowing in the 
richest purple, like a sapphire barrier to the dim 
horizon. </p>

<p>One evening in autumn as Ernest sat by his 
blazing fire and listened to the wind which roared 
past his dwelling, shaking the little casement till the 
leaves of the wild vine which curled around it fell 
rustling to the earth, he heard suddenly the latchet 
of his door raised. A man clothed in a dark mantle, 
with long hair, and a beard of raven blackness, 
entered. At sight of this singular figure he started 
up, and the stranger immediately accosted him as 
follows: </p>

<p>‘My name is Rufus Warner. I come from a great 
distance, and having been overtaken by darkness in 
the valley I looked about for some roof where I 
might pass the night. At length I espied a light 
streaming through this window. I made the best 
of my way to it, and now I request shelter from 
you.’ </p>

<p>Ernest, after gazing a moment at him, complied 
with his demand. He closed the door, and they 
both seated themselves by the fire. They sat thus 
for some time without interchanging a word, the 
stranger with his eyes intently fixed on the ascending flame, 
apparently quite inattentive to any other 
object; and Ernest as intently viewing him, and 
revolving in his mind who he might be—the cause 
of his strange attire—his long beard—his unbroken 
taciturnity—not unmixed with a feeling of awe 
allied to fear at the presence of a being of whose 
nature he was totally ignorant, and who, for aught 
he knew, might be the harbinger of no good to his 
humble dwelling. Dim, dreamlike reminiscences 
passed slowly across his mind concerning tales of 
spirits who, in various shapes; had appeared to men 
shortly before their deaths, as if to prepare them 
for the ghostly society with which they would soon 
have to mingle. </p>

<p>At length, to relieve himself of these almost insupportable 
thoughts, he ventured to accost his 
mysterious guest by inquiring whence he came. </p>

<p>‘From a rich and fruitful land,’ replied the 
stranger, ‘where the trees bear without ceasing, and 
earth casts up flowers which sparkle like jewels, the 
sun shines for ever, and the moon and stars are not 
quenched even at noonday; where the rocks lose 
themselves in the skies, and the tops of the mountains are 
invisible by reason of the firmament which 
rests upon them.’ </p>

<p>The answer, uttered in a hollow and hoarse voice, 
convinced Ernest of the truth of his surmises; but 
a charm seemed to have been cast upon him which 
prevented him from being overcome by terror, and 
he replied as follows: </p>

<p>‘If what you say is true, I should like exceedingly 
to follow you into your country instead of remaining 
here, where I am often chilled by frost and icy 
winds, and saddened by the absence of the cheering 
warmth of the sun.’ </p>

<p>‘If thou wilt go, thou mayst,’ replied the stranger; 
and Ernest, under the influence of a secret fascination, 
consented. </p>

<p>‘To-morrow, by daybreak, we will set out,’ said 
his guest; and then, as the night was far advanced, 
they both retired to their straw couches, after partaking 
of a simple supper which Ernest had hastily 
provided. </p>

<h3>CHAPTER II </h3>

<p>The rising dawn found Ernest and his unknown 
guide wending their way down the long valley. It 
was a still, gloomy October morning. The sky was 
obscured by grey clouds, and the cold wind which 
whistled among the yellow withered leaves of the 
wood that covered the rocks blew occasionally some 
mizzling drops of rain into the faces of the two 
travellers. The distant prospect of the lake and 
mountains was hidden by a veil of mist, and when 
the sun rose above them his presence was only 
revealed by a whitish light gleaming through the 
thin watery atmosphere. The only sounds which 
fell on the ear were the howling of the blast in the 
caverned sides of the valley, and the melancholy 
murmuring of the stream as its waves beat against 
the rugged stones which obstructed its passage. </p>

<p>They proceeded along in a straight course till they 
came to the borders of the lake, where the guide 
stopped, saying: ‘We must now cross this water.’ 
Ernest gazed at him a moment, and then said: </p>

<p>‘How can we? We have no boat, and I lack the 
power to swim for so long a time as it would require 
to cross this lake.’ </p>

<p>No sooner had he uttered these words than a light 
gale arose which ruffled and agitated the quiet surface 
of the lake. Presently a tiny skiff appeared 
gliding over the waves, and in a few minutes reached 
the bank whereon they stood. The stranger quickly 
sprang into the bark, and Ernest, though filled with 
terror at the conviction that he was now in the hands 
of a supernatural being, felt himself compelled by a 
strong impulse to follow whither he was led. No 
sooner were they seated than a large white sail unfurled 
seemingly of its own accord, and in a few 
moments they found themselves nearing the opposite shore, 
so lightly and swiftly this fairy vessel had 
borne them over the lake. </p>

<p>No sooner had they touched the bank with their 
feet than a huge billow like a mountain swept over 
the water. Immediately the swelling waves subsided, the 
rising foam vanished, and a great calm fell 
on the bosom of the lake. At the same moment 
Ernest felt his fear pass away, and it was succeeded 
by a feeling of courage against danger, mingled with 
a certain curiosity to see what was to come. After 
they had travelled a great distance they came to a 
wide moor that stretched to the verge of the horizon. 
This was perfectly level, save at one spot where tall 
black rocks were seen raising their heads towards the 
sky. About evening they reached these rocks, when 
they stopped and sat down to rest themselves. The 
scene was now grand and awful in the extreme. 
Around lay the dark desert heath, unenlivened by a 
single streak of verdure; its beautiful pink flowers 
were withered, and their fragrance had vanished. 
The mellow hum of the bee was no longer heard 
about them, for he had gathered his honey and was 
gone. Above rose the tremendous precipices whose 
vast shadows blackened all that portion of the moor, 
and deepened the frown upon the unpropitious face 
of nature. At intervals from the summit of the 
rocks shrill screams, uttered by some bird of prey 
which had built its nest upon them, swept through 
the arch of heaven in which wild clouds were careering to 
and fro as if torn by a horrible tempest. The 
sun had long since sunk to rest, and the full moon, 
like a broad shield dyed with blood, now ascended 
the stormy sky. A mournful halo surrounded her, 
and through that warning veil she looked from her 
place in the firmament, her glorious light dimmed 
and obscured, till the earth only knew by a faint 
ruddy tint that her white-robed handmaiden beheld her. All 
the attendant train of stars shone 
solemnly among the clouds, and by their abated 
splendour acknowledged the presence of their peerless queen. </p>

<p>After having viewed the scene some time the 
stranger rose, and beckoned Ernest to follow him. 
This he did, until he came to a particular part of the 
rocks where was seen a profound cavern. This the 
stranger entered, and Ernest felt himself impelled to 
enter too. The track seemed to incline downwards, 
and as they went deeper and deeper they soon lost 
sight of the upper world, and not a ray of light 
appeared to illumine the thick darkness around them. 
At length a faint grey dawn became visible, and at 
the same instant a warm and gentle breeze stole 
past them which softened the cold raw air of the 
cave. Anon they began to behold branches of trees 
waving above them, and saw that they trod upon a 
smooth and velvety turf. In a short time, by the 
aid of the increasing light, they perceived that they 
were in a deep gloomy forest, which, as they advanced, gradually 
thinned into a pleasant shady 
wood, becoming more beautiful as they passed on, 
until at last it assumed the appearance of a delightful 
grove. From this they soon emerged into an 
open and graceful country. A wide plain was 
stretched before them, covered with the most enchanting 
verdure. Graceful trees sprang out of the 
earth bearing delicious fruits of a perfect transparency; 
others rose to a great height, casting down 
their branches laden with white blossoms, and dark 
flourishing leaves. Crystal fountains, that fell with 
a murmuring noise, were seen glittering through 
bowers of roses and tall lilies. The melody of a 
thousand birds was heard from groves of myrtle and 
laurel which bordered a river whose waters glided 
through the plain. Arching rocks of diamond and 
amethyst, up which plants of immortal verdure 
crept, sparkled in the light and lent variety to the 
lovely prospect. The plain was bounded by hills, 
some of which rose majestically to the heavens, 
covered with vines and pomegranates, while others 
only gently swelled upon the sight, and then sank 
into calm and peaceful valleys. Over all this scene 
hung an atmosphere of crystal clearness. Not one 
fleecy cloud sullied the radiant sky; not one 
wreath of mist floated over the brows of the 
distant mountains. The whole land lay in stainless purity, 
arrayed in a robe of spiritual and 
unearthly light. </p>

<p>When Ernest emerged from the wood, this view, 
bursting at once upon his eyes, completely overpowered him. 
For a long time he stood speechless, 
gazing intently upon it. His mind seemed to be 
elevated and enlarged by the resplendency of the 
vision. All his senses were delighted: his hearing 
by the combination of sweet sounds which poured 
upon it, his sight by the harmonious blending of 
every colour and scene, and his smell by the 
fragrant perfume of each flower which bloomed in 
these everlasting fields. At length, in ecstatic 
admiration, he hastened to thank his conductor for 
bringing him thither, but when he turned the 
stranger had gone. The forest through which he 
came had vanished also, and in its stead was a vast 
ocean whose extent seemed altogether boundless. 
Ernest, now more than ever filled with astonishment, 
remained for a while alternating between fear 
and wonder; then, rousing himself, he uttered the 
name of his guide aloud. But his voice was only 
answered by a faint echo. After this he walked a 
considerable distance into the country without 
meeting with one visible being either human or 
supernatural. In a few hours he had traversed the 
plain and reached the acclivities which bordered it, 
and then entered a wide and mountainous land 
totally different from that which he had left. He 
wandered among the rocks heedless whither he 
went until twilight fell, when he longed to return, 
but was entirely unable to detect the way. No 
signs appeared of the plain he had quitted, save 
that on the southern horizon a beautiful light 
lingered long after sunset, and occasionally, as 
the wind rose, faint melodious sounds were heard 
floating fitfully by. </p>

<p>After a while, when the night had closed in, 
Ernest came to the brow of a lofty precipice. Overcome with 
fatigue he cast himself upon the ground 
and began to gaze into the profound depth beneath 
him. As he lay a deathlike stillness fell upon the 
earth. No voice was heard in the gloomy region, 
the air was untracked by any wing. No footstep 
crushed the desolate sands. Echo whispered not 
in the caverned rocks, and even the winds seemed to 
have held their breath. At length he perceived in 
the tremendous gulf a thick vapour slowly rising. 
It gradually expanded, until the chasm was filled 
with a dense cloud swaying to and fro as if moved by 
an invisible power. Then he heard a dull hollow 
noise like water roaring in subterraneous caves. By 
degrees the cloud rose and enlarged, sweeping round 
him till all things vanished from his sight, and he 
found himself encircled by its curling mist. Then 
he heard music; subdued and harmonious, resembling the soft 
breathings of flutes and dulcimers. 
This was suddenly broken by a flood of warlike 
melody rolling from golden trumpets and great 
harps of silver, which now suddenly gleamed upon 
him as the curtain of clouds rent and the whole 
scene was revealed. A pavement of sapphire 
sparkled, from which flashes of radiant purple light 
proceeded, mingling with the glory of an emerald 
dome that proudly arched a palace whose pillars 
were the purest diamond. Vases of agate and 
porphyry sent up wreaths of refined incense formed 
of the united fragrance of a thousand flowers. 
Beings of immortal beauty and splendour stood in 
shining ranks around a throne of ruby guarded by 
golden lions, and sounds so sweet and enchanting 
swelled on his ear that Ernest, overwhelmed with 
the too powerful magnificence, sank senseless on 
the bright pavement. When he recovered from his 
swoon he found himself no longer surrounded by the 
gorgeous splendour of the fairy palace, but reposing 
in a wood whose branches were just moved by a 
fresh moaning wind. The first sunbeams penetrating the green 
umbrage lighted up the dewdrops 
which glistened on tender blades of grass, or 
trembled in the cups of the wild flowers which 
bordered a little woodland well. When Ernest 
opened his eyes he beheld standing close to him a 
man whom he presently recognised to be his guide. 
He started up, and the stranger addressed him as 
follows: </p>

<p>‘I am a fairy. You have been, and still are, in 
the land of fairies. Some wonders you have seen; 
many more you shall see if you choose to follow 
me still.’ </p>

<p>Ernest consented. The fairy immediately stepped 
into the well, and he felt compelled to do the same. 
They sank gradually downwards. By degrees the 
water changed into mists and vapours; the forms 
of clouds were dimly seen floating around. These 
increased until at length they were wholly enveloped 
in their folds. In a short time they seemed to land, 
and Ernest felt his feet resting on a solid substance. 
Suddenly the clouds were dissipated, and he found 
himself in a lovely and enchanting island encircled 
by a boundless expanse of water. The trees in the 
island were beautiful: rose laurels and flowering 
myrtles, creeping pomegranates, clematis and vines, 
intermixed with majestic cypresses and groves of 
young elms and poplars. The fairy led him to a 
natural bower of lofty trees whose thick branches 
mingling above formed a shady retreat from the sun, 
which now glowed in meridian splendour. This 
bower was on a green bank of the isle, embroidered 
with every kind of sweet and refreshing flower. The 
sky was perfectly free from clouds, but a milky haze 
softened the intense brilliancy of the blue and gave 
a more unbroken calmness to the air. The lake lay 
in glassy smoothness. From its depths arose a 
sound of subdued music, a breath of harmony which 
just waved the blue water-lilies lying among their 
dark green leaves upon its surface. While Ernest 
reposed on the green turf and viewed this delightful 
prospect, he saw a vision of beauty pass before him. 
First he heard the melody of a horn, which seemed 
to come from dim mountains that appeared to the 
east. It rose again nearer, and a majestic stag of 
radiant whiteness, with branching and beaming 
golden horns, bounded suddenly into sight, pursued 
by a train of fairies mounted upon winged steeds, 
caparisoned so magnificently that rays of light shot 
from them, and the whole air was illumined with 
their glory. They flew across the lake swifter than 
wind. The water rose sparkling and foaming about 
them, agitated and roaring as if by a storm. When 
they had disappeared Ernest turned towards the 
fairy, who still continued with him, and expressed 
his admiration of the beautiful scene which had just 
vanished. The fairy replied that it was but a 
shadow compared with the things infinitely more 
grand and magnificent which were still reserved for 
him to behold. Ernest at these words replied that 
he felt extremely impatient for the time to come 
when he might see them. His conductor arose, and 
commanded Alembert to follow. This he did, and 
they proceeded to enter a dark and thick wood 
which grew on the banks of the island. They journeyed here 
for several miles, and at length emerged 
into an open glade of the forest, where was a rock 
formed like a small temple, on the summit of which, 
covered with grass and various kinds of flowers, 
grew several young poplars and other trees. This 
curious edifice the fairy entered alone. After remaining 
some time he reappeared, and approaching 
Ernest bade him look up. Alembert instantly complied, and, 
as he did so, beheld a chariot, which 
shone as the clouds that the sun glorifies at his 
setting, descending from the skies. It was drawn 
by two swans, larger than the fabulous roc, whose 
magnificent necks, arched like a rainbow, were surrounded 
by a bright halo reflected from the intense 
radiancy and whiteness of their plumage. Their 
expanded wings lightened the earth under them, 
and, as they drew nearer, their insufferable splendour so 
dazzled the senses of Ernest that he sank 
in a state of utter exhaustion to the ground. </p>

<p>His conductor then touched him with a small 
silver wand, and immediately a strange stupor came 
ever him, which in a few minutes rendered him perfectly 
insensible. When he awoke from this swoon 
he found himself in an exceedingly wide and lofty 
apartment, whose vast walls were formed of black 
marble. Its huge gloomy dome was illumined by 
pale lamps that glimmered like stars through a 
curtain of clouds. Only one window was visible, 
and that, of an immense size, and arched like those 
of an ancient Gothic cathedral, was veiled by ample 
black drapery. In the midst arose a colossal statue, 
whose lifted hands were clasped in strong supplication, 
and whose upraised eyes and fixed features 
betokened excessive anguish. It was rendered 
distinctly visible by the light of the tapers which 
burned around. As Ernest gazed on this mysterious 
room he felt a sensation of extreme awe, 
such as he had never before experienced. He knew 
that he was in a world of spirits. The scene before 
him appeared like a dim dream. Nothing was clear, 
for a visionary mist hovered over all things, that 
imparted a sense of impenetrable obscurity to his 
mental as well as his bodily eyesight. </p>

<p>After continuing awhile in this state, amidst the 
most profound silence, he heard the sweet soft tones 
of an æolian harp stealing through the tall pillared 
arches. The subdued melody rose and filled the 
air with mournful music as the wind began to moan 
around the dome. By degrees these sounds sank to 
rest, and the deathly stillness returned with a more 
chilling and oppressive power. It continued for a 
long period until its unbroken solemnity became 
supernatural and insupportable. Ernest struck the 
ground with his foot, but the blow produced no 
sound. He strove to speak, but his voice gave 
forth no utterance. At that instant a crashing peal 
of thunder burst. The wild air roared round the 
mighty building, which shook and trembled to its 
centre. Then, as the wind arose, the music swelled 
again, mingling its majestic floods of sound with the 
thunder that now pealed unceasingly. The unearthly tones 
that rolled along the blast exceeded 
everything that any mortal had heard before, and 
Ernest was nigh overwhelmed by the awe which 
their weird majesty inspired. </p>

<p>Suddenly the fairy who had been his guide appeared, and 
approaching the window beckoned him 
to come near. Ernest obeyed, and on looking out 
his eyes were bewildered by the scene which presented itself 
to his view. Nothing was visible 
beneath but billowy clouds, black as midnight, 
rolling around a tower a thousand feet in height, 
on whose terrible summit he stood. Long he gazed 
intently on the wild vapours tossed to and fro like 
waves in a storm. At times they lay in dense gloom 
and darkness, then globes or flashes of fire illumined 
them with sudden light. </p>

<p>At length the thunder and the wind ceased, the 
clouds slowly dispersed, and a growing brightness 
shone upon them. Beyond the horizon, through 
the dismal piles of mist fast fading away, a fair 
vision gleamed which filled Alembert: with wonder 
and delight. A beautiful city appeared, whose 
lovely hues charmed the eye with their mild attractive splendour. 
Its palaces, arches, pillars, and 
temples all smiled in their own gentle radiance, and 
a clear wide stream (transformed by the distance 
into a silver thread) which circled its crystal walls 
was spanned by a bright rainbow, through whose 
arch it flowed into a broad, expanse of green hills, 
woods, and valleys, enamelled by a thousand flowers 
that sent up their united fragrance so high that even 
the atmosphere around the summit of the lofty 
tower was faintly perfumed by it. </p>

<p>‘That city,’ said the guide, ‘is the abode of our 
fairy king, whose palace you may see rising above 
those long groves near the southern gates.’ </p>

<p>Ernest looked in the direction indicated, but 
beheld only a star of light, for the palace was 
formed of certain materials too brilliant for any but 
the eyes of fairies to behold. He continued some 
time at the window, until the prospect beneath, as 
twilight shed her dim influence over it, began to 
fade. Slowly the stars looked forth one by one 
from the sky’s deepening azure, and the full moon 
as she ascended the east gradually paled the bright 
orange-dye which glowed in the western heavens. 
The murmur of the aerial city died away. Only 
at intervals was heard the voice of the giant 
harp breaking the stillness of eventide, and its 
wild mournful melody as it floated on the balmy 
breeze served but to enhance the calm, sacred, and 
mysterious feeling of that peaceful hour. </p>

<p>‘We must now depart,’ said the fairy, turning 
suddenly to Alembert, and at the same instant the 
latter found himself upon the very summit of the 
tower. His conductor then, without warning, 
pushed him from the dizzy eminence into the void 
beneath. </p>

<p>Ernest gave a loud shriek of terror, but his fear 
was instantly dispelled by a delightful sensation 
which followed. He seemed to sink gently and 
slowly downwards, borne on a soft gale which now 
fanned his cheek, and guided by invisible beings 
who appeared to check the velocity of his fall, and 
to moderate his descent into a quiet and easy 
transition to the regions of the earth. </p>

<p>After a while he alighted in the fairy city, still 
attended by his conductor. They proceeded along 
a magnificent street, paved with the rarest gems, 
gorgeously sparkling in the moonlight, until they 
arrived at a majestic palace of lapis lazuli whose 
golden gates rolled back at their approach, and 
admitted them to a wide hall floored with the 
purest alabaster, richly carved and figured, and 
lighted by silver lamps perfumed with the most 
costly odours. </p>

<p>Ernest was now grown weary, and the fairy led 
him into another apartment more beautiful than 
the first. Here was a splendid couch overhung 
by a canopy adorned with emeralds, diamonds, 
sapphires, and rubies, whose excessive brilliancy 
illuminated all the room. On this couch Alembert 
flung himself joyfully down to rest. In a few 
moments a profound slumber closed his eyelids, and 
his sleep continued undisturbed until break of day, 
when he was awakened by the sweet singing of 
birds. He arose, and on looking forth from his casement 
beheld an immense garden filled with the 
sweetest flowers, and with rare plants unknown 
among mortals. Long rows of lofty trees, bearing 
fruit that sparkled like precious stones, shaded green 
walks strewn with fallen blossoms. On their fresh 
verdant branches sat innumerable birds, clothed in 
rich and resplendent plumage, who filled the air 
with delightful and harmonious warbling. </p>

<p>Ernest was astonished at beholding no appearance 
of the city, but continued for some time listening to 
the enchanting music of the birds, enjoying the 
fragrant perfume of the blossoms, and the dark 
grandeur of the majestic trees that surrounded him. 
This contemplation was at length interrupted by 
his conductor, who now appeared in the apartment. 
Without speaking, his guide led him from the 
chamber, and when they reached the open air bade 
him by a sign to look around. Ernest obeyed, and 
in place of the palace he saw a high bower formed of 
trees whose flowers were more lovely than the finest 
roses, and sweeter than lilies or camellias. The 
prospect then suddenly changed, and a deep glen, 
embosomed in hills whose sides were wooded and 
rock-strewn, took the place of the garden. A deep, 
clear-watered river flowed past them. Into this the 
fairy plunged, and Ernest, forced by an overmastering spell, 
followed him. For a long time they sank 
slowly down and nought was visible save the waters 
that swallowed them. </p>

<p>At length, leagues beneath, a new realm dawned 
upon Ernest’s astonished sight. Their speed now 
accelerated, and soon they arrived at the abode of 
a fairy king. The palace was brilliant as a liquid 
diamond. A great fountain rushing upwards from 
the earth parted into a thousand arches and pillars, 
through whose transparent surfaces appeared a 
quantity of emeralds, rubies, and other gems which 
the fountain continually cast up. The palace roof 
was formed of the frozen spray that proceeded like 
a vapour from the living arches ever in motion. 
This, congealed into round lucid drops, assumed the 
appearance of a lofty dome, from which descended 
other pillars of a larger size that seemed to support 
it. Over the summit of the dome was suspended in 
the air a sun of insufferable brightness, and from 
within gleamed a hundred stars sparkling with 
supernatural splendour. </p>

<p>By reason of the translucent nature of the edifice 
the interior was perfectly visible, and Ernest saw the 
fairy king seated on a glittering and revolving 
throne. He was surrounded by attendants, one 
of whom held a diamond cup filled with the honeydew of wild 
flowers. Others played sweetly upon 
silver harps and lutes, or sang in more melodious 
tones than the nightingale or skylark. </p>

<p>It would be impossible to relate all the marvellous 
adventures that befel Alembert whilst he abode in 
the land of Faery. He saw their midnight revels in 
many a wild glen, and witnessed how they feasted 
in the greenwood beneath the solemn moon. He 
viewed their pleasures and their pageants, and 
learned the spells by which they drew the lonely 
traveller into their enchanted circlet. Often he 
watched their sports by the ‘beached margin of the 
sea,’ and saw the rolling billows rest calmly under 
the magic influence of their incantations. He heard 
and felt the sweet witchery of their songs chanted at 
unearthly banquets, and when the sound swelled 
until it reached the starlit sky the revolving worlds 
arrested their mighty courses and stood still in the 
charmed heavens to attend. But this life in time 
grew wearying and insupportable. He longed once 
more to dwell among humankind, to hear again the 
language of mortals, and to tread upon the old green 
grass-covered turf, under the shade of the earthly 
trees he loved so well. At length the fairies perceived 
that the yearning to return was filling the 
bosom of Alembert, and that his heart was straining 
with the desire for home. This desire they appreciated, 
for they knew well that no mortal born of 
mortals could for long endure the light and fleeting 
glories of the land of Fays. Thus it was that they 
determined to relinquish him, and to bestow upon 
him the crown of his hopes. The following tells the 
manner in which they gave fulfilment to his wish. </p>

<h3>CHAPTER III </h3>

<p>It was a fair and mild evening in the decline of 
summer, when all the elfin courts assembled within 
a dell, one of those privileged spots which the pinching 
frosts and snows of winter are unable to deprive 
of their everlasting green array. The soft velvet 
turf served them for seats, and the profusion of 
sweet flowers with which it was embroidered shed 
around a refreshing perfume. The lily canopy was 
raised, and the glittering table was covered with 
crystal goblets brimming with nectarous dew. The 
song of a lark now hymning his vespers in the cloud-wrapped 
dome was all their music, and as its tones 
fell on the silent earth they diffused a holy calm on 
all. Before the festival began a fairy rose and advanced 
towards Alembert, who reposed on the 
ground a little apart. Approaching him, he presented him 
with a goblet, and bade him drink the 
contents. Ernest obeyed, and scarcely had he done 
so when a strange stupor seized him, which slowly 
overpowered all his senses. In a short time he sank 
into a profound slumber. </p>

<p>When he recovered from his stupor he found himself at the 
entrance to a wide green vale, bounded by 
high hills, whose sides were clothed with pleasant 
woods, which descended to their feet, and here and 
there advanced a considerable way into the valley. 
At intervals enormous rocks were scattered, whose 
rugged and moss-grown forms added a touch of 
romance to the delightful scene. Nor were there 
wanting pleasant groves, whose cool green shades 
offered welcome shelter to the toiling and travel-wearied 
pilgrim. It was sunset, and not one purple 
cloud was visible in all the radiant sky. The west 
swam in an ocean of golden light that bathed the 
heavens in glory, and poured its reflected splendour 
over half the world. Eastward a long line of sober 
red appeared, gradually growing softer and paler 
towards the point of sunrise. Above, all was a clear 
bright silvery blue, deepening at the zenith, and 
faintly tinged with grey as it receded from the 
gorgeous west. Beneath this sky the earth glowed 
with tints whose warm and mellow richness could 
not have been surpassed by the loveliest scenes in 
Italy. Hills, rocks, and trees shone invested in a 
lustrous halo of beauty. The vale flowed with light, 
and a hundred flowers stirred among their leaves as 
the sun shed its last beams over them. Long Ernest 
lingered, gazing entranced upon the sight. He 
knew that this was no delusive vision, and that no 
mystery hung upon its spell. As he stood a sound 
stole past him like the music of a harp. He 
trembled, fearing he was still held in the power 
of supernatural beings. The sound swelled, and, 
gathering in volume, swept solemnly down the wild 
glen, awakening low sweet echoes among the frowning rocks 
which specked the lovely woods in which 
It was embosomed. </p>

<p>Soon, however, Ernest’s fear was dissipated, for 
he heard the music accompanied by a human voice. 
He moved forward a step or two, and then bent 
eagerly towards the spot whence the tones issued, 
striving to catch the burthen of the uttered tones. 
This at length he did, and this is the song that fell 
upon his ears:— </p>

<p class="poem">Proudly the sun has sunk to rest <br>
    <span>Behind yon dim and distant hill; </span><br>
The busy noise of day has ceased, <br>
    <span>A holy calm the air doth fill. </span><br>
<br>
That softening haze which veils the light <br>
    <span>Of sunset in the gorgeous sky, </span><br>
Is dusk, grey harbinger of night, <br>
    <span>Now gliding onward silently. </span><br>
<br>
No sound rings through the solemn vale <br>
    <span>Save murmurs of those tall dark trees, </span><br>
Which raise eternally their wail, <br>
    <span>Bending beneath the twilight breeze. </span><br>
<br>
And my harp peals the woods among <br>
    <span>When vesper lifts its quiet eye, </span><br>
Commingling with each night-bird’s song <br>
    <span>That chants its vigils pensively. </span><br>
<br>
And here I sit, until night’s noon <br>
    <span>Hath gemmed the heavens with many a star, </span><br>
And sing beneath the wandering moon <br>
    <span>Who comes, high journeying, from afar. </span><br>
<br>
Oh! sweet to me is that still hour <br>
    <span>When frown the shades of night around, </span><br>
Deepening the gloom of forest bower; <br>
    <span>Filling the air with awe profound. </span><br>
<br>
I hush my harp, and hush my song, <br>
    <span>Low kneeling ’neath the lofty sky, </span><br>
I hark the nightingale prolong <br>
    <span>Her strain of wondrous melody, </span><br>
<br>
Forth gushing like a mountain rill, <br>
    <span>So rich, so deep, so clear and free; </span><br>
She pours it forth o’er dale and hill, <br>
    <span>O’er rock and river, lake and tree, </span><br>
<br>
Till morn comes, and, with rosy hand, <br>
    <span>Unbars the golden gates of day; </span><br>
Then, as at touch of magic wand, <br>
    <span>The earth is clad in fair array. </span><br>
<br>
Then from its couch the skylark springs; <br>
    <span>The trembling drops of glittering dew </span><br>
Are scattered, as with vigorous wings <br>
    <span>It mounts the glorious arch of blue. </span></p>

<p>Before the strain ceased the hues of sunset had 
begun to fade away, yet sufficient light remained 
for Ernest to perceive a man of ancient and venerable aspect 
seated at the mouth of a deep cavern, 
under the shade of an immense oak, whose massive 
limbs and dense foliage stood in dark relief against 
the sky. Every leaf and twig was dimly pencilled 
on the silvery blue, the outline of the trunk and 
larger branches alone being clearly visible. The 
stranger was clad in a long white robe and dark 
mantle which partly enveloped his person, and then, 
falling downwards, swept the ground in picturesque 
and magnificent folds. His robe was confined by a 
black girdle, down to which his snowy beard flowed 
in profusion, and formed a fine contrast to his mantle 
and belt. His right hand rested upon a harp, whose 
chords he now and then swept with his left, causing 
a few sweet transitory notes to issue therefrom, 
which rose and swelled in an uncertain cadence and 
then died away in the distance. As Ernest approached, the 
harper raised his head, and demanded 
his name. When Alembert had answered this question to the 
old man’s satisfaction, he requested permission to seat 
himself beside him for a few moments 
that he might rest. The harper instantly complied, 
and after a short pause asked him whence he came, 
and whither he went, and the reason of his being in 
so unfrequented and lonely a spot at such an unaccustomed 
hour. Ernest in reply related the whole 
of his adventures, and by the time he had completed 
their recital night had closed in, and the moon had 
risen. His host now arose and invited him to lodge 
for that night within his cave. Alembert gladly 
consented, and together they proceeded to enter. 
When they were seated at their frugal supper of 
fruits and herbs, Ernest in his turn begged the 
old man to recount the circumstances of his own 
life. To this request he gave a ready assent, and 
proceeded to unfold the following story:— </p>

<p>‘You have told me that your latter years have 
been spent among fairies. I likewise abode for a 
time with supernatural beings, but theirs was a less 
gentle nature than those whom you have described. 
When yet: very young I became embued with the 
spirit of adventure, and determined to go out and 
seek my fortune in the world. The quarter of the 
globe which I fixed upon as the first scene of my 
wanderings was Asia, and accordingly I embarked 
myself on board a ship bound for Odessa. In a few 
days we set sail, and after a prosperous voyage 
arrived at that part of the Russian dominions. 
From thence I proceeded to Tcherkask, where I 
halted a few days, and then went on to Good-Gard, 
a mountain in the Caucasus. Here I decided to 
venture upon crossing that stupendous range alone. 
Upon communicating my intentions to some of the 
natives, they solemnly warned me against such an 
enterprise, assuring me that many powerful genii 
held their courts among the snows of Elbruz 
and Kasbec. These words I disregarded, and 
as soon as extreme fatigue would permit me I 
began to ascend the Good-Gard road. With great 
difficulty I proceeded along this road for several 
days, until I reached the towering Elbruz. During 
the whole of my journey this mountain had been 
partly hidden from me by the minor hills that 
surrounded it, but upon emerging from a gorge in 
the last of these a full view of its tremendous magnitude 
burst upon my sight. It was a fair and sunny 
afternoon in autumn when I first beheld the sublime 
vision. The mountain was separated from me only 
by a lovely green valley, through which a branch of 
the Aragua<sup><a id="note2text"></a><a href="#note2">*</a></sup> wound its silent course. Never shall 
I forget that inspiring scene. The mountain towered 
before me, the grandeur of its radiant summit 
majestically cleaving the skies; its yawning abysses 
and clefts sufficiently wide to engulf a city; and 
its immovable aspect firm as if its base were fixed 
beyond the seas. As I gazed, suddenly the mountain trembled, 
the top rent asunder, and a huge 
grim spirit rose from the horrible chasm thus produced. 
He raised his head to heaven, and uttered 
a cry which shook all Georgia. At this mystic 
appearance I sank to the ground insensible. When 
I recovered from my swoon I found myself in a vast 
cave, illuminated only by an opening at the top, 
through which one ray of light streamed in. On 
looking round I perceived an iron door fitted in the 
side of the cave. This, with much difficulty, I 
opened, and found beyond a narrow passage tending downwards. 
I entered, and continued for 
several hours to follow whither it led. At length 
I heard in the distance a dull noise like the roaring 
of the sea, and after a while found myself borne 
upon the bosom of a rushing wave. I was hurried 
through the waters without fear or injury, whilst 
strange and ghastly scenes saluted my wondering 
eyes. Anon I was walking at the bottom of the 
ocean. A thousand huge monsters lay there, 
glaring with fixed and solemn eyes through the 
tenebrous gloom. I saw the kraken with its 
hundred arms, the great whale, the sea bear, and 
others unknown to dwellers upon the earth. Voiceless they 
glided through the regions of eternal 
silence, and the black billows broke far above them 
in the midst of loneliness and solitude. Unutterable were 
the feelings with which I viewed the 
foundation of the everlasting hills, and beheld the 
trackless pathways of the unfathomed sea. Lustrous gems 
glittered on every side; groves of coral 
begirt each rock; myriads of pearls gleamed constantly around; 
and the loveliest shells shone below 
me, to be crushed at each movement of my feet. 
Slowly I advanced until I espied a cavern, which 
opened before me. This I entered. Instantly a 
wave rose behind me and swept me swiftly down an 
abyss which led beneath the arches of a magnificent 
palace, larger and grander than any that can be 
boasted of in the lands which rise above the ocean’s 
surface. There I saw, coiled in his own vast halls, 
that mystic snake known among ancient Scalds by 
the name of Jormandugar. He it is who holds the 
earth girdled in his toils. For many days I sojourned 
here, and beheld sights of which no mortal tongue 
can tell. After a season: I returned to the cave in 
Elbruz, whence I was taken by the spirit who had 
brought me thither. Since then I have wandered 
in many regions of the earth, mingled with the 
peoples of many lands, and seen the myriad wonders 
of the world. At length, compelled by age, I have 
retired to this valley, where I have now dwelt in 
happiness and peace for twenty years.’ </p>

<p>Here the old man ended his recital. Ernest 
thanked him for his narrative, adding that he likewise longed 
to spend the remainder of his days in 
that same lovely glen. The old man approved of 
his design, and for many years they two dwelt 
together in perfect harmony, tranquillity, and peace. </p>

<h3>PREFACE </h3>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">I have</span> written this tale out of malignity for the 
injuries that have lately been offered to me. Many 
parts, especially the former, were composed under 
a mysterious influence that I cannot account for. </p>

<p>My reader will easily recognise the characters 
through the thin veil which I have thrown over 
them. I have considerably flattered Lady Zelvia 
Ellrington. She is not nearly so handsome as I 
have represented her, and she strove far more 
vigorously to oust some one from another person’s 
good graces than I say. But her endeavours failed. 
Albion has hitherto stood firm. What he will do 
I cannot even pretend to guess; but I think that 
Marina’s incomparable superiority will prevail over 
her Frenchified rival, who, as all the world knows, is 
a miller, jockey, talker, blue-stocking, charioteer, 
and beldam united in one… </p>

<p>The conclusion is wholly destitute of any foundation in 
truth, and I did it out of revenge. Albion 
and Marina are both alive and well for aught I know. </p>

<p>One thing, however, will certainly break my heart, 
and that is the admission of any scandal against 
Tree (the publisher); but I hope my readers will 
pardon me for it, as I promise to make amends with 
usury the next time I write a book. </p>

<h3>CHAPTER I <br>

<small>ALBION </small></h3>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">There</span> is a certain sweet little pastoral village in the 
south of England with which I am better acquainted 
than most men. The scenery around it possesses no 
distinguishing characteristic of romantic grandeur 
or wildness that might figure to advantage in a 
novel, to which high title this brief narrative sets up 
no pretensions. </p>

<p>Neither rugged lofty rocks, nor mountains dimly 
huge, mark with frowns the undisturbed face of 
nature; but little peaceful valleys, low hills crowned 
with wood, murmuring cascades and streamlets, 
richly cultivated fields, farmhouses, cottages, and a 
wide river, form all the scenic features. And every 
hamlet has one or more great men. </p>

<p>This had one and he was ‘na sheep-shanks.’ </p>

<p>Every ear in the world had heard of his fame, and 
every tongue could bear testimony to it. I shall 
name him the Duke of Strathelleraye, and by that 
name the village was likewise denominated. </p>

<p>For more than thirty miles around every inch of 
ground belonged to him and every man was his 
retainer. </p>

<p>The magnificent villa, or rather palace, of this 
noble, stood on an eminence, surrounded by a vast 
park and the embowering shade of an ancient wood, 
proudly seeming to claim the allegiance of all the 
countryside. </p>

<p>The mind, achievements, and character of its 
great possessor, must not, <i>can</i> not, be depicted by 
a pen so feeble as mine; for though I could call 
filial love and devoted admiration to my aid, yet 
both would be utterly ineffective. </p>

<p>Though the duke seldom himself came among his 
attached vassals, being detained elsewhere by important 
avocations, yet his lady the duchess resided 
in the castle constantly. Of her I can only say that 
she was like an earthly angel. Her mind was composed of 
charity, beneficence, gentleness, and sweetness. All, 
both old and young, loved her; and the 
blessings of those that were ready to perish came 
upon her evermore. </p>

<p>His Grace had also two sons, who often visited 
Strathelleraye. </p>

<p>Of the youngest, Lord Cornelius, everything is 
said when I inform the reader that he was seventeen 
years of age, grave, sententious, stoical, rather 
haughty and sarcastic, of a fine countenance though 
somewhat swarthy; that he had long thick hair 
black as the hoody’s wing; and liked nothing so 
well as to sit in moody silence musing over the 
vanity of human affairs, or improving and expanding his 
mind by the abstruse study of the higher 
branches of mathematics, and that sublime science 
astronomy. </p>

<p>The eldest son, Albion, Marquis of Tagus, is the 
hero of my present tale. He had entered his nineteenth year; 
his stature was lofty; his form equal 
in the magnificence of its proportions to that of 
Apollo Belvedere. The bright wealth and curls of 
his rich brown hair waved over a forehead of the 
purest marble in the placidity of its unveined whiteness. 
His nose and mouth were cast in the most 
perfect mould. But saw I never anything to equal 
his eye! Oh! I could have stood riveted with the 
chains of admiration gazing for hours upon it! 
What clearness, depth, and lucid transparency in 
those large orbs of radiant brown! And the fascination of 
his smile was irresistible, though seldom 
did that sunshine of the mind break through the 
thoughtful and almost melancholy expression of 
his noble features. He was a soldier, captain in 
the Royal Regiment of Horse Guards, and all his 
attitudes and actions were full of martial grace. 
His mental faculties were in exact keeping with 
such an exterior, being of the highest order; and 
though not like his younger brother, wholly given 
up to study, yet he was well versed in the ancient 
languages, and deeply read in the Greek and Roman 
classics, in addition to the best works in the British, 
German, and Italian tongues. </p>

<p>Such was my hero. The only blot I was ever able 
to discover in his character was that of a slight 
fierceness or impetuosity of temper which sometimes carried 
him beyond bounds, though at the 
slightest look or word of command from his father 
he instantly bridled his passion and became perfectly calm. </p>

<p>No wonder the duke should be, as he was, proud 
of such a son. </p>

<h3>CHAPTER II <br>

<small>MARINA </small></h3>

<p>About two miles from the castle there stood a 
pretty house, entirely hid from view by a thick 
forest, in a glade of which it was situated. </p>

<p>Behind it was a smooth lawn fringed with odoriferous shrubs, 
and before it a tasteful flower garden. </p>

<p>This was the abode of Sir Alured Angus, a Scotchman, who 
was physician to His Grace, and though 
of gentlemanly manners and demeanour, yet harsh, 
stern, and somewhat querulous in countenance and 
disposition. </p>

<p>He was a widower, and had but one child, a 
daughter, whom I shall call Marina, which nearly 
resembles her true name. </p>

<p>No wild rose blooming in solitude, or bluebell 
peering from an old wall, ever equalled in loveliness 
this flower of the forest. The hue of her cheek 
would excel the most delicate tint of the former, 
even when its bud is just opening to the breath of 
summer, and the clear azure of her eyes would cause 
the latter to appear dull as a dusky hyacinth. 
Also, the silken tresses of her hazel hair straying in 
light ringlets down a neck and forehead of snow 
seemed more elegant than the young tendrils of 
a vine. Her dress was almost Quaker-like in its 
simplicity. Pure white or vernal green were the 
colours she constantly wore, without any jewels 
save one row of pearls round her neck. She never 
stirred beyond the precincts of the wooded and 
pleasant green lane which skirted a long cornfield 
near the house. There on warm summer evenings 
she would ramble and linger listening to the woodlark’s 
song, and occasionally join her own more 
harmonious voice to its delightful warblings. </p>

<p>When the gloomy days and nights of autumn and 
winter did not permit these walks she amused herself 
with drawing (for which she had an exact taste), 
playing on the harp, reading the best English, 
French, and Italian works (all which languages she 
understood) in her father’s extensive library, and 
sometimes a little light needlework. </p>

<p>Thus in a state of almost perfect seclusion (for 
seldom had she even Sir Alured’s company, as he 
generally resided in London) she was quite happy, 
and reflected with innocent wonder on those who 
could find pleasure in the noisy delights of what is 
called ‘fashionable society.’ </p>

<p>One day, as Lady Strathelleraye was walking in 
the wood she met Marina, and on learning who she 
was, being charmed with her beauty and sweet 
manners, invited her to go on the morrow to the 
castle. She did so, and there met the Marquis of 
Tagus. <i>He</i> was even more surprised and pleased 
with her than the duchess, and when she was gone 
he asked his mother many questions about her, all 
of which she answered to his satisfaction. </p>

<p>For some time afterwards he appeared listless and 
abstracted. The reader will readily perceive that 
he had, to use a cant phrase, ‘fallen in love.’ </p>

<p>Lord Cornelius, his brother, warned him of the 
folly of doing so; but instead of listening to his sage 
admonitions he first strove to laugh, and then 
frowning at him commanded silence. </p>

<p>In a few days he paid a visit to Oakwood House 
(Sir Alured’s mansion), and after that became more 
gloomy than before. </p>

<p>His father observed this, and one day as they were 
sitting alone remarked it to Albion, adding that he 
was fully acquainted with the reason. </p>

<p>Albion reddened but made no answer. </p>

<p>‘I am not, my son,’ continued the duke, ‘opposed 
to your wishes, though certainly there is a considerable 
difference of rank between yourself and Marina 
Angus, but that difference is compensated by the 
many admirable qualities she possesses.’ </p>

<p>On hearing these words, Arthur,—Albion, I mean,
—started up, and throwing himself at his father’s 
feet, poured forth his thanks in terms of glowing 
gratitude, while his fine features, flushed with 
excitation, spoke even more eloquently than his 
eloquent words. </p>

<p>‘Rise, Albion!’ said the duke; ‘you are worthy 
of her and she of you; but both are yet too young. 
Some years must elapse before your union takes 
place; therefore exert your patience, my son.’ </p>

<p>Albion’s joy was slightly damped by this news, 
but his thankfulness and filial obedience as well as 
love forced him to acquiesce, and immediately after 
he quitted the room and took his way to Oakwood 
House. </p>

<p>There he related the circumstance to Marina, 
who, though she blushed incredulously, yet in truth 
felt as much gladness and as great a relief from doubt 
almost amounting to despair as himself. </p>

<h3>CHAPTER III <br>

<small>GLASS TOWN </small></h3>

<p>A few months afterwards the Duke of Strathelleraye determined 
to visit that wonder of the world, 
the great city of Africa: the Glass Town, of whose 
splendour, magnificence, and extent, strength and 
riches, occasional tidings came from afar, wafted by 
breezes of the ocean to Merry England. </p>

<p>But to most of the inhabitants of that little isle it 
bore the character of a dream or gorgeous fiction. 
They were unable to comprehend how mere human 
beings could construct fabrics of such a marvellous 
size and grandeur as many of the public buildings 
were represented to be; and as to the ‘Tower of 
all the Nations,’ few believed in its existence. It 
seemed as the cities of old: Nineveh or Babylon 
with the temples of their gods, Ninus or Jupiter 
Belus, and their halls of Astarté and Semalt. These 
most people believe to be magnified by the dim haze 
of intervening ages, and the exaggerating page of 
history through which medium we behold them. </p>

<p>The duke, as he had received many invitations 
from the Glass Townians, who were impatient to 
behold one whose renown had spread so far, and 
who likewise possessed vast dominions near the 
African coast, informed his lady, the Marquis of 
Tagus, and Lord Cornelius, that in a month’s time 
he should take his departure with them, and that 
he should expect them all to be prepared at that 
period, adding that when they returned Marina 
Angus should be created Marchioness of Tagus. </p>

<p>Though it was a bitter trial to Albion to part with 
one to whom he was now so entirely devoted, yet, 
comforted by the last part of his father’s speech, 
he obeyed without murmuring. </p>

<p>On the last evening of his stay in Strathelleraye 
he took a sad farewell of Marina, who wept as if 
hopeless; but suddenly restraining her griefs she 
looked up, with her beautiful eyes irradiated by a 
smile that like a ray of light illumined the crystal 
tears, and whispered: </p>

<p>‘I shall be happy when you return.’ </p>

<p>Then they parted; and Albion during his voyage 
over the wide ocean often thought for comfort on 
her last words. </p>

<p>It is a common superstition that the words uttered 
by a friend on separating are prophetic, and these 
certainly portended nothing but peace. </p>

<h3>CHAPTER IV <br>

<small>LITERARY AMBITIONS </small></h3>

<p>In due course of time they arrived at the Glass 
Town, and were welcomed with enthusiastic 
cordiality. </p>

<p>After the duke had visited his kingdom he returned to the 
chief metropolis and established his 
residence there at Salamanca Palace. </p>

<p>The Marquis of Tagus from the noble beauty of 
his person attracted considerable attention wherever 
he went, and in a short period he had won and 
attached many faithful friends of the highest rank 
and abilities. </p>

<p>From his love of elegant literature and the fine 
arts in general, painters and poets were soon among 
his warmest admirers. He himself possessed a most 
sublime genius, but as yet its full extent was 
unknown to him. </p>

<p>One day as he was meditating alone on the world 
of waters that rolled between him and the fair 
Marina, he determined to put his feelings on paper 
in a tangible shape that he might hereafter show 
them to her when anticipation had given place to 
fruition. He took his pen, and in about a quarter of 
an hour had completed a brief poem of exquisite 
beauty. The attempt pleased him and soothed the 
anguish that lingered in his heart. It likewise gave 
him an insight into the astonishing faculties of his 
own mind; and a longing for immortality, an 
ambition of glory, seized him. </p>

<p>He was a devoted worshipper of the divine works 
that the Grecian tragedians have left for all succeeding 
ages to marvel at, particularly those of 
Sophocles the Majestic; and his mind was deeply 
embued with the spirit of their eagle-like flights 
into higher regions than that of earth or even 
Parnassus. </p>

<p>Being now sensible in a degree of his lofty powers, 
he determined, like Milton, to write somewhat that 
the traditionary muses would not willingly let die, 
and accordingly commenced a tragedy entitled: 
‘Necropolis, or the City of the Dead.’ Here was 
set forth in a strain of the grandest mind the 
mysteries of ancient Egyptian worship; and he has 
acknowledged to me that he felt his being absorbed 
while he wrote it, even by the words himself had 
made. </p>

<p>Sublime is this surprising production! It is indeed, in 
the words of an eminent writer (Captain 
Tree), ‘a noble instance of the almost perfectibility 
of human intellect’; but there hovers over it a 
feeling of tender melancholy, for the image of 
Marina haunted his thoughts, and Amalthea, his 
heroine, is but an impersonation of her. </p>

<p>This tragedy wreathed the laurels of fame round 
his brow, and his after-productions, each of which 
seemed to excel the other, added new wreaths to 
those which already beautified his temples. </p>

<p>I cannot follow him in the splendour of his literary 
career, nor even mention so much as the titles of 
his various works. Suffice it to say he became one 
of the greatest poets of the age; and one of the 
chief motives that influenced him in his exertions 
for renown was to render himself worthy to possess 
such a treasure as Marina. She in whatever he 
was employed was never out of his thoughts, and 
none had he as yet beheld among all the ladies of 
the Glass Town,—though rich, titled, and handsome strove 
by innumerable arts to gain his favour,
—whom he could even compare with her. </p>

<h3>CHAPTER V <br>

<small>LADY ZELVIA ELLRINGTON </small></h3>

<p>One evening Albion was invited to the house of 
Earl Cruachan, where was a large party assembled. 
Among the guests was one lady apparently about 
twenty-five or twenty-six years of age. In figure 
she was very tall, and both it and her face were of 
a perfectly Roman cast. Her features were regularly and 
finely formed, her full and brilliant eyes 
jetty black, as were the luxuriant tresses of her 
richly-curled hair. Her dark glowing complexion 
was set off by a robe of crimson velvet trimmed with 
ermine, and a nodding plume of black ostrich feathers 
added to the imposing dignity of her appearance. </p>

<p>Albion, notwithstanding her unusual comeliness, 
hardly noticed her till Earl Cruachan rose and introduced 
her to him as the Lady Zelvia Ellrington. </p>

<p>She was the most learned and noted woman in 
Glass Town, and he was pleased with this opportunity of 
seeing her. </p>

<p>For some time she entertained him with a discourse of the 
most lively eloquence, and indeed 
Madame de Staël herself could not have gone beyond 
Lady Zelvia in the conversational talent; and on 
this occasion she exerted herself to the utmost, as 
she was in the presence of so distinguished a man, 
and one whom she seemed ambitious to please. </p>

<p>At length one of the guests asked her to favour 
the company with a song and tune on the grand 
piano. At first she refused, but on Albion seconding 
the request rose, and taking from the drawing-room 
table a small volume of poems opened it at one by 
the Marquis of Tagus. She then set it to a fine air 
and sang as follows, while she skilfully accompanied 
her voice upon the instrument:— </p>

<p class="poem">I think of thee when the moonbeams play <br>
    <span>On the placid water’s face; </span><br>
For thus thy blue eyes’ lustrous ray <br>
    <span>Shone with resembling grace. </span><br>
<br>
I think of thee when the snowy swan <br>
    <span>Glides calmly down the stream; </span><br>
Its plumes the breezes scarcely fan, <br>
    <span>Awed by their radiant gleam. </span><br>
<br>
For thus I’ve seen the loud winds hush <br>
    <span>To pass thy beauty by, </span><br>
With soft caress and playful rush <br>
    <span>’Mid thy bright tresses fly. </span><br>
<br>
And I have seen the wild birds sail <br>
    <span>In rings thy head above, </span><br>
While thou hast stood like lily pale <br>
    <span>Unknowing of their love. </span><br>
<br>
Oh! for the day when once again <br>
    <span>Mine eyes shall gaze on thee; </span><br>
But an ocean vast, a sounding main, <br>
    <span>An ever howling sea, </span><br>

<p>This song had been composed by Albion soon 
after his arrival at the Glass Town. The person 
addressed was Marina. The full rich tones of Lady 
Zelvia’s voice did ample justice to the subject, and 
he expressed his sense of the honour she had done 
him in appropriate terms. </p>

<p>When she had finished the company departed, 
for it was then rather late. </p>

<h3>CHAPTER VI <br>

<small>THE SPIRIT OF MARINA </small></h3>

<p>As Albion pursued his way homewards alone he 
began insensibly to meditate on the majestic charms 
of Lady Zelvia Ellrington, and to compare them with 
the gentler ones of Marina Angus. At first he could 
hardly tell which to give the preference to, for 
though he still almost idolised Marina, yet an absence 
of four years had considerably deadened his remembrance 
of her person. </p>

<p>While he was thus employed he heard a soft but 
mournful voice whisper ‘Albion!’ </p>

<p>He turned hastily round, and saw the form of the 
identical Marina at a little distance distinctly visible 
by the moonlight. </p>

<p>‘Marina! My dearest Marina!’ he exclaimed, 
springing towards her, while joy unutterable filled 
his heart; ‘how did you come here? Have the 
angels in Heaven brought you?’ </p>

<p>So saying he stretched out his hand, but she eluded 
his grasp, and slowly gliding away, said: ‘Do not 
forget me; I shall be happy when you return.’ </p>

<p>Then the apparition vanished. It seemed to have 
appeared merely to assert her superiority over her 
rival, and indeed the moment Albion beheld her 
beauty he felt that it was peerless. </p>

<p>But now wonder and perplexity took possession 
of his mind. He could not account for this vision 
except by the common solution of supernatural 
agency, and that ancient creed’ his enlightened 
understanding had hitherto rejected until it was 
forced upon him by this extraordinary incident. </p>

<p>One thing there was, however, the interpretation 
of which he thought he could not mistake, and that 
was the repetition of her last words: ‘I shall be 
happy when you return.’ It showed that she was 
still alive, and that which he had seen could not be 
her wraith. However, he made a memorandum of 
the day and hour, namely, the 18th of June 1815, 
twelve o’clock at night. </p>

<p>From this time the natural melancholy turn of 
his disposition increased, for the dread of her death 
before he should return was constantly before him, 
and the ardency of his adoration and desire to see 
her again redoubled. </p>

<p>At length, not being able any longer to bear his 
misery he revealed it to his father; and the duke, 
touched with his grief and the fidelity of his attachment, 
gave him full permission to visit England and 
bring back Marina with him to Africa. </p>

<h3>CHAPTER VII <br>

<small>ALBION’S RETURN </small></h3>

<p>I need not trouble the reader with a minute detail 
of the circumstances of Albion’s voyage, but shall 
pass on to what happened after he arrived in 
England. </p>

<p>It was a fair evening in September 1815 when he 
reached Strathelleraye. </p>

<p>Without waiting to enter the halls of his fathers 
he proceeded immediately to Oakwood House. As 
he approached it he almost sickened when for an 
instant the thought that she might be no more 
passed across his mind, but summoning hope to his 
aid and resting on her golden anchor he passed up 
the lawn and gained the glass doors of the drawing-room. </p>

<p>As he drew near a sweet symphony of harp music 
swelled on his ear. His heart bounded within him 
at the sound. He knew that no fingers but hers 
could create those melodious tones with which now 
blended the harmony of a sweet and sad but well-known 
voice. He lifted the vine branch that shaded 
the door and beheld Marina, more beautiful he 
thought than ever, seated at her harp sweeping with 
her slender fingers the quivering chords. </p>

<p>Without being observed by her, as she had her 
face turned from him, he entered, and sitting down 
leaned his head on his hand and, closing his eyes, 
listened with feelings of overwhelming transport to 
the following words:— </p>

<p class="poem">Long my anxious ear hath listened <br>
    <span>For the step that ne’er returned; </span><br>
And my tearful eye hath glistened, <br>
    <span>And my heart hath daily burned, </span><br>
                            <span style="margin-left:150px">But now I rest. </span><br>
<br>
Nature’s self seemed clothed in mourning; <br>
    <span>Even the star-like woodland flower, </span><br>
With its leaflets fair, adorning <br>
    <span>The pathway to the forest-bower, </span><br>
                            <span style="margin-left:150px">Drooped its head. </span><br>
<br>
From the cavern of the mountain, <br>
    <span>From the groves that crown the hill, </span><br>
From the stream, and from the fountain, <br>
    <span>Sounds prophetic murmured still, </span><br>
                            <span style="margin-left:150px">Betokening grief. </span><br>
<br>
Boding winds came fitful, sighing, <br>
    <span>Through the tall and leafy trees; </span><br>
Birds of omen, wildly crying, <br>
    <span>Sent their calls upon the breeze </span><br>
                            <span style="margin-left:150px">Wailing round me. </span><br>
<br>
At each sound I paled and trembled, <br>
    <span>At each step I raised my head, </span><br>
Hearkening if it his resembled, <br>
    <span>Or if news that he was dead </span><br>
                            <span style="margin-left:150px">Were come from far. </span><br>
<br>
All my days were days of weeping; <br>
    <span>Thoughts of grim despair were stirred; </span><br>
Time on leaden feet seemed creeping; <br>
    <span>Long heart-sickness, hope deferred </span><br>
                            <span style="margin-left:150px">Cankered my heart. </span></p>

<p>Here the music and singing suddenly ceased. </p>

<p>Albion raised his head. All was darkness except 
where the silver moonbeams showed a desolate and 
ruined apartment instead of the elegant parlour 
that a few minutes before had gladdened his sight. </p>

<p>No trace of Marina was visible, no harp or other 
instrument of harmony, and the cold lunar light 
streamed through a void space instead of the glass 
door. He sprang up and called aloud: ‘Marina! 
Marina!’ But only an echo as of empty rooms 
answered. Almost distracted he rushed into the 
open air. A child was standing alone at the garden 
gate, who advanced towards him and said: ‘I will 
lead you to Marina Angus; she has removed from 
that house to another.’ </p>

<p>Albion followed the child till they came to a long 
row of tall dark trees leading to a churchyard, which 
they entered, and the child vanished, leaving Albion 
beside a white marble tombstone on which was 
chiselled:— </p>

<p style="text-align: center; text-indent:0em; margin-bottom:0.5em; margin-top:0.5em; font-size:90%">MARINA ANGUS <br>
She died <br>
18th of June 1815 <br>
at <br>
12 o’clock <br>
midnight. </p>

<p>When Albion had read this he felt a pang of 
horrible anguish wring his heart and convulse his 
whole frame. With a loud groan he fell across the 
tomb and lay there senseless a long time, till at 
length he was waked from the death-like trance to 
behold the spirit of Marina, which stood beside him 
for a moment, and then murmuring, ‘Albion, I am 
happy, for I am at peace,’ disappeared! </p>

<p>For a few days he lingered round her tomb, and 
then quitted Strathelleraye, where he was never 
again heard of. </p>

<br>

<p>The reason of Marina’s death I shall briefly relate. 
Four years after Albion’s departure tidings came to 
the village that he was dead. The news broke 
Marina’s faithful heart. The day after, she was 
no more. </p>

<p class="play">Through vaulted isles, are the low forest sounds </p>

<p class="play">Whose swelling cadences and dying falls </p>

<p class="title">THE FAIRY GIFT </p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">One</span> cold evening in December 17—, while I was 
yet but a day labourer, though not even at that time 
wholly without some aspirations after fame and 
some intimations of future greatness, I was sitting 
alone by my cottage fire engaged in ambitious 
reveries of <i>l’avenir</i>, and amusing myself with wild 
and extravagant imaginations. A thousand evanescent wishes 
flitted through my mind, one of which 
was scarcely formed when another succeeded it; 
then a third, equally transitory, and so on. </p>

<p>While I was thus employed with building castles 
in the air my frail edifices were suddenly dissipated 
by an emphatic ‘Hem!’ I started, and raised my 
head. Nothing was visible, and, after a few 
minutes, supposing it to be only fancy, I resumed 
my occupation of weaving the web of waking visions. 
Again the ‘Hem!’ was heard; again I looked up, 
when lo! sitting in the opposite chair I beheld the 
diminutive figure of a man dressed all in green. 
With a pretty considerable fluster I demanded his 
business, and how he had contrived to enter the 
house without my knowledge. </p>

<p>‘I am a fairy,’ he replied, in a shrill voice; ‘but 
fear nothing; my intentions are not mischievous. 
On the contrary, I intend to gift you with the power 
of obtaining four wishes, provided that you wish 
them at different times; and if you should happen 
to find the fruition of my theme not equal to your 
anticipations, still you are at liberty to cast it 
aside, which you must do before another wish is 
granted.’ </p>

<p>When he had concluded this information he gave 
me a ring, telling me that by the potency of the spell 
with which it was invested my desires would prove 
immediately successful. </p>

<p>I expressed my gratitude for this gift in the warmest terms, 
and then inquired how I should dispose 
of the ring when I had four times arrived at the 
possession of that which I might wish. </p>

<p>‘Come with it at midnight to the little valley in 
the uplands, a mile hence,’ said he, ‘and there you 
will be rid of it when it becomes useless.’ </p>

<p>With these words he vanished from my sight. I 
stood for some minutes incredulous of the reality of 
that which I had witnessed, until at last I was convinced 
by the green-coloured ring set in gold that 
sparkled in my hand. </p>

<p>By some strange influence I had been preserved 
from any feeling of fear during my conversation with 
the fairy, but now I began to feel certain doubts and 
misgivings as to the propriety of having any dealings with 
supernatural beings. These, however, I 
soon quelled, and began forthwith to consider what 
should be the nature of my first wish. After some 
deliberation I found the desire for beauty was uppermost 
in my mind, and therefore formed a wish that 
next morning when I arose I should find myself 
possessed of surpassing loveliness. </p>

<p>That night my dreams were filled with anticipations of future 
grandeur, but the gay visions which 
my sleeping fancy called into being were dispelled 
by the first sounds of morning. </p>

<p>I awoke lightsome and refreshed, and springing 
out of bed glanced half-doubtingly into the small 
looking-glass which decorated the wall of my apartment, 
to ascertain if any change for the better had 
been wrought in me since the preceding night. </p>

<p>Never shall I forget the thrill of delighted surprise 
which passed through me when I beheld my altered 
appearance. There I stood, tall, slender, and graceful as 
a young poplar tree, all my limbs moulded in 
the most perfect and elegant symmetry, my complexion of 
the purest red and white, my eyes blue 
and brilliant, swimming in liquid radiance under the 
narrow dark arches of two exquisitely-formed eyebrows, my 
mouth of winning sweetness, and, lastly, 
my hair clustering in rich black curls over a forehead 
smooth as ivory. </p>

<p>In short, I have never yet heard or read of any 
beauty that could at all equal the splendour of 
comeliness with which I was at that moment 
invested. </p>

<p>I stood for a long time gazing at myself in a trance 
of admiration while happiness such as I had never 
known before overflowed my heart. That day happened to be 
Sunday, and accordingly I put on my 
best clothes and proceeded forthwith towards the 
church. The service had just commenced when I 
arrived, and as I walked up the aisle to my pew I felt 
that the eyes of the whole assembly were upon me, 
and that proud consciousness gave an elasticity to 
my gait which added stateliness and majesty to my 
other innumerable graces. Among those who viewed 
me most attentively was Lady Beatrice Ducie. This 
personage was the widow of Lord Ducie, owner of 
the chief part of the village where I resided and 
nearly all the surrounding land for many miles, who, 
when he died, left her the whole of his immense 
estates. She was without children and perfectly at 
liberty to marry whomsoever she might chance to 
fix her heart on, and therefore, though her ladyship 
had passed the meridian of life, was besides fat and 
ugly, and into the bargain had the reputation of 
being a witch, I cherished hopes that she might take 
a liking for me, seeing I was so very handsome; and 
by making me her spouse raise me at once from indigence 
to the highest pitch of luxury and affluence. </p>

<p>These were my ambitious meditations as I slowly 
retraced my steps homeward. </p>

<p>In the afternoon I again attended church, and 
again Lady Ducie favoured me with many smiles 
and glances expressive of her admiration. At length 
my approaching good fortune was placed beyond a 
doubt, for while I was standing in the porch after 
service was over she happened to pass, and inclining 
her head towards me, said: ‘Come to my house to-morrow at 
four o’clock.’? I only answered by a low 
bow and then hastened back to my cottage. </p>

<p>On Monday afternoon I dressed myself in my best, 
and putting a Christmas rose in the buttonhole of 
my coat, hastened to the appointed rendezvous. </p>

<p>When I entered the avenue of Ducie Castle a footman in rich 
livery stopped me and requested me to 
follow him. I complied, and we proceeded down a 
long walk to a bower of evergreens, where sat her 
ladyship in a pensive posture. Her stout, lusty 
figure was arrayed in a robe of purest white muslin, 
elegantly embroidered. On her head she wore an 
elaborately curled wig, among which borrowed 
tresses was twined a wreath of artificial flowers, 
and her brawny shoulders were enveloped in a 
costly Indian shawl. At my approach she arose 
and saluted me. I returned the compliment, and 
when we were seated, and the footman had withdrawn, business 
summarily commenced by her 
tendering me the possession of her hand and heart, 
both which offers, of course, I willingly accepted. </p>

<p>Three weeks after, we were married in the parish 
church by special licence, amidst the rejoicings of 
her numerous tenantry, to whom a sumptuous 
entertainment was that day given. </p>

<p>I now entered upon a new scene of life. Every 
object which met my eyes spoke of opulence and 
grandeur. Every meal of which I partook seemed 
to me a luxurious feast. As I wandered through 
the vast halls and magnificent apartments of my 
new residence I felt my heart dilating with gratified 
pride at the thought that they were my own. </p>

<p>Towards the obsequious domestics that thronged 
around me I behaved with the utmost respect and 
deference, being impelled thereto by a feeling of awe 
inspired by their superior breeding and splendid 
appearance. </p>

<p>I was now constantly encompassed by visitors 
from among those who moved in the highest circles 
of society. My time was passed in the enjoyment 
of all sorts of pleasures; balls, concerts, and dinners 
were given almost every day at the castle in honour 
of our wedding. My evenings were spent in hearing 
music, or seeing dancing and gormandising; my 
days in excursions over the country, either on 
horseback or in a carriage. </p>

<p>Yet, notwithstanding all this, I was not happy. 
The rooms were so numerous that I was often lost in 
my own house, and sometimes got into awkward 
predicaments in attempting to find some particular 
apartment. Our high-bred guests despised me for 
my clownish manners and deportment. I was forced 
to bear patiently the most humiliating jokes and 
sneers from noble lips. My own servants insulted 
me with impunity; and, finally, my wife’s temper 
showed itself every day more and more in the most 
hideous light. She became terribly jealous, and 
would hardly suffer me to go out of her sight a 
moment. In short, before the end of three months 
I sincerely wished myself separated from her and 
reduced again to the situation of a plain and coarse 
but honest and contented ploughboy. </p>

<p>This separation was occasioned by the following 
incident sooner than I expected. At a party which 
we gave one evening there chanced to be present a 
young lady named Cecilia Standon. She possessed 
no mean share of beauty, and had besides the most 
graceful demeanour I ever saw. Her manner was 
kind, gentle, and obliging, without any of that 
haughty superciliousness which so annoyed me in 
others of my fashionable acquaintances. If I made 
a foolish observation or transgressed against the 
rules of politeness she did not give vent to her contempt 
in a laugh or suppressed titter, but informed 
me in a whisper what I ought to have done, and 
instructed me how to do it. </p>

<p>When she was gone I remarked to my wife what a 
kind and excellent lady Miss Cecilia Standon was. 
‘Yes,’ exclaimed she, reddening, ‘every one can 
please you but me. Don’t think to elude my vigilance, I 
saw you talking and laughing with her, you 
low-born creature whom I raised from obscurity to 
splendour. And yet not one spark of gratitude do 
you feel towards me. But I will have my revenge.’ 
So saying she left me to meditate alone on what that 
revenge might be. </p>

<p>The same night, as I lay in bed restless, I heard 
suddenly a noise of footsteps outside the chamber 
door. Compelled by irresistible curiosity, I rose and 
opened it without making any sound. My surprise 
was great on beholding the figure of my wife stealing 
along on tiptoe with her back towards me, and a 
lighted candle in her hand. Anxious to know what 
could be her motive for walking about the house at 
this time of night I followed softly, taking care to 
time my steps so as to coincide with hers. </p>

<p>After proceeding along many passages and galleries which 
I had never before seen, we descended 
a very long staircase that led us underneath the coal 
and wine cellars to a damp, subterraneous vault. 
Here she stopped and deposited the candle on the 
ground. I shrank instinctively, for the purpose of 
concealment, behind a massive stone pillar which 
upheld the arched roof on one side. </p>

<p>The rumours which I had often heard of her being 
a witch passed with painful distinctness across my 
mind, and I trembled violently. Presently she 
knelt with folded hands and began to mutter some 
indistinguishable words in a strange tone. Flames 
now darted out of the earth, and huge smouldering 
clouds of smoke rolled over the slimy walls, concealing 
their hideousness from the eye. </p>

<p>At length the dead silence that had hitherto 
reigned unbroken was dissipated by a tremendous 
cry which shook the house to its centre, and I saw 
six black, indefinable figures gliding through the 
darkness bearing a funeral bier on which lay 
arranged, as I had seen her the previous evening, 
the form of Cecilia Standon. Her dark eyes were 
closed, and their long lashes lay motionless on a 
cheek pale as marble. She was quite stiff and dead. </p>

<p>At this appalling sight I could restrain myself no 
longer, and uttering a loud shriek I sprang from 
behind the pillar. My wife saw me. She started 
from her kneeling position, and rushed furiously 
towards where I stood, exclaiming in tones rendered 
tremulous by excessive fury: ‘Wretch, wretch, 
what demon has lured thee hither to thy fate?’ 
With these words she seized me by the throat and 
attempted to strangle me. </p>

<p>I screamed and struggled in vain. Life was 
ebbing apace when suddenly she loosened her grasp, 
tottered, and fell dead. </p>

<p>When I was sufficiently recovered from the effects 
of her infernal grip to look around I saw by the light 
of the candle a little man in a green coat striding 
over her and flourishing a bloody dagger in the air. 
In his sharp, wild physiognomy I immediately recognised 
the fairy who six months ago had given me 
the ring. </p>

<p>That was the occasion of my present situation. 
He had stabbed my wife through the heart, and thus 
afforded me opportune relief at the moment when I 
so much needed it. </p>

<p>After tendering him my most ardent thanks for 
his kindness I ventured to ask what we should do 
with the dead body. </p>

<p>‘Leave that to me,’ he replied. ‘But now as 
the day is dawning, and I must soon be gone, do you 
wish to return to your former rank of a happy, 
honest labourer, being deprived of the beauty which 
has been the source of so much trouble to you, or 
will you remain as you are? Decide quickly, for 
my time is limited.’ </p>

<p>I replied unhesitatingly, ‘Let me return to my 
former rank,’ and no sooner were the words out of 
my mouth than I found myself standing alone at the 
porch of my humble cottage, plain and coarse as 
ever, without any remains of the extreme comeliness 
with which I had been so lately invested. </p>

<p>I cast a glance at the tall towers of Ducie Castle 
which appeared in the distance faintly illuminated 
by the light reflected from rosy clouds hovering over 
the eastern horizon, and then, stooping as I passed 
beneath the lowly lintel, once more crossed the 
threshold of my parental hut. </p>

<p>A day or two after, while I was sitting at breakfast; a 
neighbour entered and, after inquiring how I 
did, etc., asked me where I had been for the last 
half year. Seeing it necessary to dissemble, I 
answered that I had been on a visit to a relation 
who lived at a great distance. This satisfied him, 
and I then inquired if anything had happened in 
the village since my departure. </p>

<p>‘Yes,’ said he, ‘a little while after you were gone 
Lady Ducie married the handsomest young man 
that was ever seen, but nobody knew where he came 
from, and most people thought he was a fairy; and 
now about four days ago Lady Ducie, her husband, 
and Lord Standon’s eldest daughter all vanished in 
the same night and have never been heard of since, 
though the strictest search has been made after 
them. Yesterday her ladyship’s brother came and 
took possession of the estate, and he is trying to 
hush up the matter as much as he can.’ </p>

<p>This intelligence gave me no small degree of satisfaction, 
as I was now certain that none of the 
villagers had any suspicion of my dealings with the 
fairy. </p>

<p>But to proceed. I had yet liberty to make three 
more wishes; and, after much consideration, being 
convinced of the vanity of desiring such a transitory 
thing as my first, I fixed upon ‘superior talent’ as the 
aim of my second wish; and no sooner had I done so 
than I felt an expansion, as it were, of soul within me. </p>

<p>Everything appeared to my mental vision in a 
new light. High thoughts elevated my mind, and 
abstruse meditations racked my brain continually. 
But you shall presently hear the upshot of this 
sudden éclaircissement. </p>

<p>One day I was sent to a neighbouring market 
town, by one Mr. Tenderden, a gentleman of some 
consequence in our village, for the purpose of buying 
several articles in glass and china. </p>

<p>When I had made my purchases I directed them 
to be packed up in straw, and then with the basket 
on my back trudged off homeward. But ere I was 
half-way night overtook me. There was no moon, 
and the darkness was also much increased by a small 
mizzling rain. Cold and drenched to the skin, I 
arrived at The Rising Sun, a little wayside inn, 
which lay in my route. </p>

<p>On opening the door my eyes were agreeably 
saluted by the light of a bright warm fire, round 
which sat about half a dozen of my acquaintance. </p>

<p>After calling for a drop of something to warm me, 
and carefully depositing the basket of glass on the 
ground, I seated myself amongst them. They were 
engaged in a discussion as to whether a monarchical 
or republican form of government was the best. 
The chief champion of the republican side was Bob 
Sylvester, a blacksmith by trade, and of the largest 
loquacity of any man I ever saw. He was proud of 
his argumentative talents, but by dint of my fairy 
gift I soon silenced him, amid cheers from both sides 
of the house. </p>

<p>Bob was a man of hot temper, and not calculated 
for lying down quietly under a defeat. He therefore rose 
and challenged me to single combat. I 
accepted, and a regular battle ensued. After some 
hard hits he closed in furiously, and-dealt me a tremendous 
left-handed blow. I staggered, reeled, and 
fell insensible. The last thing I remember was a 
horrible crash as if the house was tumbling in about 
my ears. </p>

<p>When I recovered my senses I was laid in bed in 
my own house, all cut, bruised, and bloody. I was 
soon given to understand that the basket of glass 
was broken, and Mr. Tenderden, being a miserly, 
hard-hearted man, made me stand to the loss, which 
was upwards of five pounds. </p>

<p>When I was able to walk about again I determined 
to get rid of my ring forthwith in the manner the 
fairy had pointed out, seeing that it brought me 
nothing but ill-luck. </p>

<p>It was a fine clear night in October when I reached 
the little valley in the uplands before mentioned. 
There was a gentle frost, and the stars were twinkling 
with the lustre of diamonds in a sky of deep and 
cloudless azure. A chill breeze whistled dreamily in 
the gusty passes of the hills that surrounded the 
vale, but I wrapped my cloak around me and standing in a 
sheltered nook boldly awaited the event. </p>

<p>After about half an hour of dead silence I heard a 
sound as of many voices weeping and lamenting at a 
distance. This continued for some time until it was 
interrupted by another voice, seemingly close at 
hand. I started at the contiguity of the sound, and 
looked on every side, but nothing was visible. Still 
the strain kept rising and drawing nearer. At length 
the following words, sung in a melancholy though 
harmonious tone, became distinctly audible:— </p>

<p class="poem">Hearken, O Mortal! to the wail <br>
    <span>Which round the wandering night-winds fling, </span><br>
Soft-sighing ’neath the moonbeams pale, <br>
    <span>How low! how old! its murmuring! </span><br>
<br>
No other voice, no other tone, <br>
    <span>Disturbs the silence deep; </span><br>
All, saving that prophetic moan, <br>
    <span>Are hushed in quiet sleep. </span><br>
<br>
The moon and each small lustrous star, <br>
    <span>That journey through the boundless sky, </span><br>
Seem, as their radiance from afar <br>
    <span>Falls on the still earth silently, </span><br>
<br>
To weep the fresh descending dew <br>
    <span>That decks with gems the world: </span><br>
Sweet teardrops of the glorious blue <br>
    <span>Above us wide unfurled. </span><br>
<br>
But, hark! again the sighing wail <br>
    <span>Upon the rising breeze doth swell. </span><br>
Oh! hasten from this haunted vale, <br>
    <span>Mournful as a funeral knell! </span><br>
<br>
For here, when gloomy midnight reigns, <br>
    <span>The fairies form their ring, </span><br>
And, unto wild unearthly strains, <br>
    <span>In measured cadence sing. </span><br>
<br>
No human eye their sports may see, <br>
    <span>No human tongue their deeds reveal; </span><br>
The sweetness of their melody <br>
    <span>The ear of man may never feel. </span><br>
<br>
But now the elfin horn resounds, <br>
    <span>No longer mayst thou stay; </span><br>
Near and more near the music sounds, <br>
    <span>Then, Mortal, haste away! </span></p>

<p>Here I certainly heard the music of a very sweet 
and mellow horn. At that instant the ring which 
I held in my hand melted and became like a drop of 
dew, which trickled down my fingers and falling on 
the dead leaves spread around, vanished. </p>

<p>Having now no further business I immediately 
quitted the valley and returned home… </p>

<p>Being very tired and sleepy I retired to bed. As 
I have no doubt my reader is by this time in much 
the same state, I bid him good-bye. </p>

<p class="title">LOVE AND JEALOUSY </p>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> the autumn of the year 1831, being weary of 
study, and the melancholy solitude of the vast 
streets and mighty commercial marts of our great 
Babel, and being fatigued with the ever-resounding 
thunder of the sea, with the din of a thousand self-moving 
engines, with the dissonant cries of all 
nations, kindreds, and tongues, congregated together 
in the gigantic emporium of commerce, of arts, of 
God-like wisdom, of boundless learning, and of 
superhuman knowledge; being dazzled with continually beholding 
the glory, the power, the riches, 
dominion, and radiant beauty of the city which 
sitteth like a queen upon the waters; in one word, 
being tired of Verdopolis and all its magnificence, 
I determined on a trip into the country. </p>

<p>Accordingly, the day after this resolution was 
formed, I rose with the sun, collected a few essential 
articles of dress, etc., packed them neatly in a light 
knapsack, arranged my apartment, partook of a 
wholesome repast, and then, after locking the door 
and delivering the key to my landlady, I set out 
with a light heart and joyous step. </p>

<p>After three days of continued travel I arrived on 
the banks of a wide and profound river winding 
through a vast valley embosomed in hills whose robe 
of rich and flowery verdure was broken only by the 
long shadow of groves, and here and there by 
clustering herds and flocks lying, white as snow, in 
the green hollows between the mountains. It was 
the evening of a calm summer day when I reached 
this enchanting spot. The only sounds now audible 
were the songs of shepherds, swelling and dying at 
intervals, and the murmur of gliding waves. I 
neither knew nor cared where I was. My bodily 
faculties of eye and ear were absorbed in the contemplation 
of this delightful scene, and, wandering 
unheedingly along, I left the guidance of the river 
and entered a wood, invited by the warbling of a 
hundred forest minstrels. Soon I perceived the 
narrow, tangled woodpath to widen, and gradually 
it assumed the appearance of a green shady alley. 
Occasionally bowers of roses and myrtles appeared 
by the pathside, with soft banks of moss for the 
weary to repose on. Notwithstanding these indications of 
individual property, curiosity and the allurements of 
music and cool shade led me forwards. At 
length I entered a glade in the wood, in the midst of 
which was a small but exquisitely beautiful marble 
edifice of pure and dazzling whiteness. On the 
broad steps of the portico two figures were reclining, 
at sight of whom I instantly stepped behind a low, 
wide-spreading fig-tree, where I could hear and see 
all that passed without fear of detection. One was 
a youth of lofty stature and remarkably graceful 
demeanour, attired in a rich purple vest and mantle, 
with closely fitting white pantaloons of white woven 
silk, displaying to advantage the magnificent proportions 
of his form. A richly adorned belt was 
girt tightly round his waist from which depended 
a scimitar whose golden hilt, and scabbard of the 
finest Damascus steel, glittered with gems of inestimable 
value. His steel-barred cap, crested with 
tall, snowy plumes, lay beside him, its absence 
revealing more clearly the rich curls of dark, glossy 
hair clustering round a countenance distinguished 
by the noble beauty of its features, but still more by 
the radiant fire of genius and intellect visible in the 
intense brightness of his large, dark, and lustrous 
eyes. </p>

<p>The other form was that of a very young and 
slender girl, whose complexion was delicately, almost 
transparently, fair. Her cheeks were tinted with a 
rich, soft crimson, her features moulded in the utmost 
perfection of loveliness; while the clear light of 
her brilliant hazel eyes, and the soft waving of her 
auburn ringlets, gave additional charms to what 
seemed already infinitely too beautiful for this earth. 
Her dress was a white robe of the finest texture the 
Indian loom can produce. The only ornaments she 
wore were a long chain which encircled her neck 
twice and hung lower than her waist, composed of 
alternate beads of the finest emeralds and gold; and 
a slight gold ring on the third finger of her left hand, 
which, together with a small crescent of pearls 
glistening on her forehead (which is always worn 
by the noble matrons of Verdopolis), betokened that 
she had entered the path of wedded life. With a 
sweet vivacity in her look and manner the young 
bride was addressing her lord thus when I first came 
in sight of the peerless pair: </p>

<p>‘No, no, my lord; if I sing the song you shall 
choose it. Now, once more, what shall I sing? The 
moon is risen, and, if your decision is not prompt, I 
will not sing at all!’ </p>

<p><a id="page_126"></a>To this he answered: ‘Well, if I am threatened 
with the entire loss of the pleasure if I defer 
my choice, I will have that sweet song which I 
overheard you singing the evening before I left 
Scotland.’<sup><a id="note3text"></a><a href="#note3">*</a></sup> </p>

<p>With a smiling blush she took a little ivory lyre, 
and, in a voice of the most touching melody, sang 
the following stanzas:— </p>

<p class="poetry">He is gone, and all grandeur has fled from the mountain; <br>
All beauty departed from stream and from fountain; <br>
            <span style="padding-left:20%">A dark veil is hung </span><br>
        <span style="padding-left:15%">O’er the bright sky of gladness, </span><br>
            <span style="padding-left:20%">And, where birds sweetly sung, </span><br>
        <span style="padding-left:15%">There’s a murmur of sadness; </span><br>
    <span style="padding-left:10%">The wind sings with a warning tone </span><br>
        <span style="padding-left:15%">Through many a shadowy tree; </span><br>
    <span style="padding-left:10%">I hear, in every passing moan, </span><br>
        <span style="padding-left:15%">The voice of destiny. </span><br>
<br>
Then, O Lord of the Waters! the Great and All-seeing! <br>
Preserve in Thy mercy his safety and being; <br>
            <span style="padding-left:20%">May he trust in Thy might </span><br>
        <span style="padding-left:15%">When the dark storm is howling, </span><br>
            <span style="padding-left:20%">And the blackness of night </span><br>
        <span style="padding-left:15%">Over Heaven is scowling; </span><br>
    <span style="padding-left:10%">But may the sea flow glidingly </span><br>
        <span style="padding-left:15%">With gentle summer waves; </span><br>
    <span style="padding-left:10%">And silent may all tempests lie </span><br>
        <span style="padding-left:15%">Chained in Æolian caves! </span><br>
<br>
Yet, though ere he returnest long years will have vanished, <br>
Sweet hope from my bosom shall never be banished: <br>
            <span style="padding-left:20%">I will think of the time </span><br>
        <span style="padding-left:15%">When his step, lightly bounding, </span><br>
            <span style="padding-left:20%">Shall be heard on the rock </span><br>
        <span style="padding-left:15%">Where the cataract is sounding; </span><br>
    <span style="padding-left:10%">When the banner of his father’s host </span><br>
        <span style="padding-left:15%">Shall be unfurled on high, </span><br>
    <span style="padding-left:10%">To welcome back the pride and boast </span><br>

<p>When the lady had concluded her song I stepped 
from my place of concealment, and was instantly 
perceived by the noble youth (whom, of course, 
every reader will have recognised as the Marquis 
of Douro). </p>

<p>He gave me a courteous welcome, and invited me 
to proceed with him to his country palace, as it was 
now wearing late. I willingly accepted the invitation, and, 
in a short time, we arrived there. </p>

<p>It is a truly noble structure, built in the purest 
style of Grecian architecture, situated in the midst 
of a vast park, embosomed in richly wooded hills, 
perfumed with orange and citron groves, and watered 
by a branch of the Gambia, almost equal in sight to 
the parent stream. </p>

<p>The magnificence of the interior is equal to that 
of the outside. There is an air of regal state and 
splendour throughout all the lofty domed apartments which 
strikes the spectator with awe for the 
lord of so imposing a residence. The marquis has a 
particular pride in the knowledge that he is the 
owner of one of the most splendid, select, and 
extensive libraries now in the possession of any individual. 
His picture and statue galleries likewise 
contain many of the finest works, both of the ancient 
and modern masters, particularly the latter, of 
whom the marquis is a most generous and munificent 
patron. In his cabinet of curiosities I observed 
a beautiful casket of wrought gold. At my request 
he opened it and produced the contents, viz. a manuscript 
copy of that rare work, ‘The Autobiography 
of Captain Leaf.’ It was written on a roll of 
vellum, but much discoloured and rendered nearly 
illegible by time. To my eager inquiries respecting 
the manner in which he had obtained so inestimable 
a treasure, he replied, with a smile: </p>

<p>‘That question I must decline to answer. It is a 
secret with which I alone am acquainted.’ </p>

<p>I likewise noticed a brace of pistols, most exquisitely 
wrought and highly finished. He told me 
they were the <i>chef-d’œuvre</i> of Darrow, the best 
manufacturer of firearms in the universe. I counted 
one hundred gold and silver medals, which had been 
presented to this youthful but all-accomplished 
nobleman by different literary and scientific establishments. 
They were all contained in a truly 
splendid gold vase awarded to him last year by the 
Academy of Modern Athenians (as that learned body 
somewhat presumptuously chooses to style itself) as 
being the composer of the best epigram in Greek. 
Above this was suspended a silver bow and quiver, 
the first prize given by the Royal Society of Archers, 
together with a bit, bridle, spurs, and stirrups, all of 
fine gold, obtained from the Honourable Community 
of Equestrians. Near these lay several withered 
wreaths of myrtle, laurel, etc., etc., won by him as 
conqueror in the great African Biennial Games. On 
a rich stand of polished ebony were ranged twenty-three 
beautiful vases of marble, alabaster, etc., all 
richly carved in basso-relievo, remarkable for classic 
elegance of form, design, and execution. Some of 
these were filled with cameos, others with ancient 
coins, and others again bore branches of scarlet and 
white coral, pearls, gems of various sorts, fossils, etc. 
But what interested me more than all these trophies 
of victory and specimens of art and nature, costly, 
beautiful, and almost invaluable as they were, was 
a little figure of Apollo, about six inches in height, 
curiously carved in white agate, holding a lyre in his 
hand, and placed on a pedestal of the same valuable 
material, on which was the following inscription:— </p>

<p class="blockquote">In our day we beheld the god of Archery, Eloquence, and 
Verse, shrined in an infinitely fairer form than that worn 
by the ancient Apollo, and giving far more glorious proofs 
of his divinity than the day-god ever vouchsafed to the 
inhabitants of the old Pagan world. Zenobia Ellrington 
implores Arthur Augustus Wellesley to accept this small 
memorial, and consider it as a token that, though forsaken 
and despised by him whose good opinion and friendship 
she valued more than life, she yet bears no malice. </p>

<p>There was a secret contained in this inscription 
which I could not fathom. I had never before 
heard of any misunderstanding between his lordship 
and Lady Zenobia, nor did public appearances 
warrant a suspicion of its existence. Long after, 
however, the following circumstances came to my 
knowledge. The channel through which they 
reached me cannot be doubted, but I am not at 
liberty to mention names. </p>

<p><sup><a id="note5text"></a><a href="#note5">*</a></sup> One evening about dusk, as the Marquis of Douro 
was returning from a shooting excursion into the 
country, he heard suddenly a rustling noise in a 
deep ditch on the roadside. He was preparing his 
fowling-piece for a shot when the form of Lady 
Ellrington started up before him. Her head was 
bare, her tall person was enveloped in the tattered 
remnants of a dark velvet mantle. Her dishevelled 
hair hung in wild elf-locks over her face, neck, and 
shoulders, almost concealing her features, which 
were emaciated and pale as death. He stepped 
back a few paces, startled at the sudden and ghastly 
apparition. She threw herself on her knees before 
him, exclaiming in wild, maniacal accents: </p>

<p>‘My lord, tell me truly, sincerely, ingenuously, 
where you have been. I heard that you had left 
Verdopolis, and I followed you on foot five hundred 
miles. Then my strength failed me, and I lay down 
in this place, as I thought, to die. But it was 
doomed I should see you once more before I became 
an inhabitant of the grave. Answer me, my lord: 
Have you seen that wretch Marian Hume? Have 
you spoken to her? Viper! Viper! Oh, that I 
could sheathe this weapon in her heart!’ </p>

<p>Here she stopped for want of breath, and, drawing a long, 
sharp, glittering knife from under her 
cloak, brandished it wildly in the air. The marquis 
looked at her steadily, and, without attempting to 
disarm her, answered with great composure: </p>

<p>‘You have asked me a strange question, Lady 
Zenobia; but, before I attempt to answer, you had 
better come with me to our encampment. I will 
order a tent to be prepared for you where you may 
pass the night in safety, and, to-morrow, when you 
are a little recruited by rest and refreshment, we 
will discuss this matter soberly.’<sup><a id="note6text"></a><a href="#note6">*</a></sup> </p>

<p>Her rage Was now exhausted by its own vehemence, and she 
replied with more calmness than she 
had hitherto evinced: </p>

<p>‘My lord, believe me, I am deputed by Heaven 
to warn you of a great danger into which you are 
about to fall. If you persist in your intention of 
uniting yourself to Marian Hume you will become 
a murderer and a suicide. I cannot explain myself 
more clearly; but ponder carefully on my words 
until I see you again.’ </p>

<p>Then, bowing her forehead to the ground in an 
attitude of adoration, she kissed his feet, muttering 
at the same time some unintelligible words. At that 
moment a loud rushing, like the sound of a whirlpool, became 
audible, and Lady Zenobia was swept 
away by some invisible power before the marquis 
could extend his arms to arrest her progress, or frame 
an answer to her mysterious address. He paced 
slowly forward, lost in deep reflection on what he 
had heard and seen. The moon had risen over the 
black, barren mountains ere he reached the camp. 
He gazed for awhile on her pure, undimmed lustre, 
comparing it to the loveliness of one far away, and 
then, entering his tent, wrapped himself in his 
hunter’s cloak, and lay down to unquiet sleep. </p>

<p>Months rolled away, and the mystery remained 
unravelled. Lady Zenobia Ellrington appeared as 
usual in that dazzling circle of which she was ever 
a distinguished ornament. There was no trace of 
wandering fire in her eyes which might lead a careful 
observer to imagine that her mind was unsteady. 
Her voice was more subdued and her looks pale, 
and it was remarked by some that she avoided all 
(even the most commonplace) conversation with the 
marquis. </p>

<p>In the meantime the Duke of Wellington had consented to 
his son’s union with the beautiful, virtuous, 
and accomplished, but untitled, Marian Hume. </p>

<p>Vast and splendid preparations were making for the 
approaching bridal, when just at this critical juncture 
news arrived of the Great Rebellion headed by 
Alexander Rogue. The intelligence fell with the 
suddenness and violence of a thunderbolt. Unequivocal symptoms 
of dissatisfaction began to 
appear at the same time among the lower orders in 
Verdopolis. The workmen at the principal mills 
and furnaces struck for an advance of wages, and, 
the masters refusing to comply with their exorbitant demands, 
they all turned out simultaneously. 
Shortly after, Colonel Grenville, one of the great 
millowners, was shot. His assassins being quickly 
discovered and delivered up to justice were interrogated 
by torture, but they remained inflexible, not a 
single satisfactory answer being elicited from them. 
The police were now doubled. Bands of soldiers 
were stationed in the more suspicious parts of the 
city, and orders were issued that no citizen should 
walk abroad unarmed. In this state of affairs 
Parliament was summoned to consult on the best 
measures to be taken. On the first night of its 
sitting the house was crowded to excess. All the 
members attended, and above a thousand ladies of 
the first rank appeared in the gallery. A settled 
expression of gloom and anxiety was visible in every 
countenance. They sat for some time gazing at 
ache other in the silence of seeming despair. At 
length the Marquis of Douro rose and ascended 
the tribune. It was on this memorable night he 
pronounced that celebrated oration which will be 
delivered to posterity as a finished specimen of the 
sublimest eloquence. The souls of all who heard 
him were thrilled with conflicting emotions. Some 
of the ladies in the gallery fainted and were carried 
out. My limits will not permit me to transcribe the 
whole of this speech, and to attempt an abridgment 
would be profanation. I will, however, present the 
reader with the conclusion. It was as follows:— </p>

<p class="blockquote">I will call upon you, my countrymen, to rouse yourselves 
to action. There is a latent flame of rebellion smouldering 
in our city, which blood alone can quench: the hot blood 
of ourselves and our enemies freely poured forth! We 
daily see in our streets men whose brows were once open 
as the day, but which are now wrinkled with dark dissatisfaction, 
and the light of whose eyes, formerly free as 
sunshine, is now dimmed by restless suspicion. Our upright 
merchants are ever threatened with fears of assassination 
from those dependants who, in time past, loved, 
honoured, and reverenced them as fathers. Our peaceful 
citizens cannot pass their thresholds in safety unless laden 
with weapons of war, the continual dread of death haunting 
their footsteps wherever they turn. And who has 
produced this awful change? What agency of hell has 
affected, what master-spirit of crime, what prince of sin, 
what Beelzebub of black iniquity, has been at work in 
this Kingdom? I will answer that fearful question: 
<span class="smcap">Alexander Rogue</span>! Arm for the battle, then, fellow-countrymen; 
be not faint-hearted, but trust in the justice of 
your cause as your banner of protection, and let your war-shout 
in the onslaught ever be: ‘God defend the right!’ </p>

<p>When the marquis had concluded this harangue, 
he left the house amidst long and loud thunders of 
applause, and proceeded to one of the shady groves 
planted on the banks of the Guadima. Here he 
walked for some time inhaling the fresh night-wind, 
which acquired additional coolness as it swept over 
the broad rapid river, and was just beginning to 
recover from the strong excitement into which his 
enthusiasm had thrown him when he felt his arm 
suddenly grasped from behind, and turning round 
beheld Lady Zenobia Ellrington standing beside 
him, with the same wild, unnatural expression of 
countenance which had before convulsed her features 
among the dark hills of Gibbel Kumri. </p>

<p>‘My lord,’ she muttered, in a low, energetic tone, 
‘your eloquence, your noble genius has again 
driven me to desperation. I am no longer mistress 
of myself, and if you do not consent to be mine, and 
mine alone, I will kill myself where I stand.’ </p>

<p>‘Lady Ellrington,’ said the marquis coldly, withdrawing 
his hand from her grasp, ‘this conduct is 
unworthy of your character. I must beg that you 
will cease to use the language of a madwoman, for 
I do assure you, my lady, these deep stratagems will 
have no effect upon me.’ </p>

<p>She now threw herself at his feet, exclaiming in a 
voice almost stifled with ungovernable emotion: </p>

<p>‘Oh! do not kill me with such cold, cruel disdain. 
Only consent to follow me, and you will be convinced that 
you ought not to be united to one so 
utterly unworthy of you as Marian Hume.’ </p>

<p>The marquis, moved by her tears and entreaties, 
at length consented to accompany her. She led 
him a considerable distance from the city to a subterranean 
grotto, where was a fire burning on a 
brazen altar. She threw a certain powder into the 
flame, and immediately they were transported 
through the air to an apartment at the summit of a 
lofty tower. At one end of this room was a vast 
mirror, and at the other a drawn curtain, behind 
which a most brilliant light was visible. </p>

<p>‘You are now,’ said Lady Ellrington, ‘in the 
sacred presence of one whose counsel, I am sure, 
you, my lord, will never slight.’ </p>

<p>At this moment the curtain was removed, and the 
astonished marquis beheld Crashie, the divine and 
infallible, seated on his golden throne, and surrounded 
by those mysterious rays of light which 
ever emanate from him. </p>

<p>‘My son,’ said he, with an august smile, and in 
a voice of awful harmony, ‘fate and inexorable 
destiny have decreed that in the hour you are 
united to the maiden of your choice, the angel 
Azazel shall smite you both, and convey your disembodied 
souls over the swift-flowing and impassable river of 
death. Hearken to the counsels of 
wisdom, and do not, in the madness of self-will, 
destroy yourself and Marian Hume by refusing the 
offered hand of one who, from the moment of your 
birth, was doomed by the prophetic stars of heaven 
to be your partner and support through the dark, 
unexplored wilderness of future life.’ </p>

<p>He ceased. The combat betwixt true love and 
duty raged for a few seconds in the marquis’s heart, 
and sent his life-blood in a tumult of agony and 
despair burning to his cheek and brow. At length 
duty prevailed, and, with a strong effort, he said in 
a firm, unfaltering voice: </p>

<p>‘Son of Wisdom! I will war no longer against 
the high decree of heaven, and here I swear by the 
eternal—’</p>

<p>The rash oath was checked in the moment of its 
utterance by some friendly spirit who whispered in 
his ear: </p>

<p>‘There is magic. Beware!’ </p>

<p>At the same time Crashie’s venerable form faded 
away, and in its stead appeared the evil genius, 
Danhasch,<sup><a id="note7text"></a><a href="#note7">*</a></sup> in all the naked hideousness of his real 
deformity. The demon soon vanished with a wild 
howl of rage, and the marquis found himself again 
in the grove with Lady Ellrington. </p>

<p>She implored him on her knees to forgive an 
attempt which love alone had dictated, but he 
turned from her with a smile of bitter contempt 
and disdain, and hastened to his father’s palace. </p>

<p>About a week after this event the nuptials of 
Arthur Augustus, Marquis of Douro, and Marian 
Hume were solemnized with unprecedented pomp 
and splendour. Lady Ellrington, when she thus 
saw that all her hopes were lost in despair, fell into 
deep melancholy, and while in this state she amused 
herself with carving the little image before mentioned. 
After a long time she slowly recovered, and 
the marquis, convinced that her extravagances had 
arisen from a disordered brain, consented to honour 
her with his friendship once more. </p>

<br>

<p>I continued upwards of two months at the Marquis of Douro’s 
palace, and then returned to Verdopolis, equally delighted 
with my noble host and his fair, amiable bride. </p>

<h2><a href="#chap09" id="chap09"></a>NAPOLEON AND THE SPECTRE </h2>


<div class="ednote">
<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">This</span> story was printed by Mr. Clement Shorter in February 
1919, in an edition limited to twenty-five copies for private 
circulation only. Extracts from it were printed in <i>Poet-Lore</i>, 
vol. ix., Autumn Number, 1897. The complete 
story is now published for the first time. </p>

<p>In the Introduction by Mr. Shorter in the privately 
printed pamphlet we are informed that the story is supposed 
to be ‘told at an inn by a traveller whose name 
is not given, but who is described as a dapper little man, 
dressed in brown coat and waistcoat and cream-coloured 
continuations.’ </p>

<p>I venture to copy the following further extract from 
Mr. Shorter’s Introduction to the story:— </p>

<p class="blockquote">The identity of the ghost is revealed by Napoleon’s exclamation 
when he is recovering from his somnambulistic trance, 
‘Where in the world is Piche?’ Piche is General Pichegru, 
who, when Napoleon was first consul, joined in a plot to 
assassinate him. The plot was discovered and Pichegru was arrested 
and imprisoned; but before the day fixed for his trial ‘he was 
found dead in his cell with his black silk cravat twisted tightly 
round his neck by means of a stick.’ </p>

<p class="blockquote" style="margin-top:-1em">Whether he was strangled at the instigation of Napoleon, as 
has been asserted by some historians, is not clear; but Charlotte 
Brontë apparently believed in Napoleon’s guilt, and in the story 
causes the ghost of his victim to haunt him. </p>

</div>



<p class="title">NAPOLEON AND THE SPECTRE </p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">Well,</span> as I was saying, the Emperor got into bed. </p>

<p>‘Chevalier,’ says he to his valet, ‘let down those 
window-curtains, and shut the casement before you 
leave the room.’ </p>

<p>Chevalier did as he was told, and then, taking up 
his candlestick, departed. </p>

<p>In a few minutes the Emperor felt his pillow 
becoming rather hard, and he got up to shake it. 
As he did so a slight rustling noise was heard near the 
bed-head. His Majesty listened, but all was silent 
as he lay down again. </p>

<p>Scarcely had he settled into a peaceful attitude of 
repose, when he was disturbed by a sensation of 
thirst. Lifting himself on his elbow, he took a glass 
of lemonade from the small stand which was placed 
beside him. He refreshed himself by a deep 
draught. As he returned the goblet to its station 
a deep groan burst from a kind of closet in one 
corner of the apartment. </p>

<p>‘Who’s there?’ cried the Emperor, seizing his 
pistols. ‘Speak, or I’ll blow your brains out.’ </p>

<p>This threat produced no other effect than a short, 
sharp laugh, and a dead silence followed. </p>

<p>The Emperor started from his couch, and, hastily 
throwing on a <i>robe-de-chambre</i> which hung over the 
back of a chair, stepped courageously to the haunted 
closet. As he opened the door something rustled. 
He sprang forward sword in hand. No soul or even 
substance appeared, and the rustling, it was evident, 
proceeded from the falling of a cloak, which had 
been suspended by a peg from the door. </p>

<p>Half ashamed of himself he returned to bed. </p>

<p>Just as he was about once more to close his eyes, 
the light of the three wax tapers, which burned in a 
silver branch over the mantelpiece, was suddenly 
darkened. He looked up. A black, opaque shadow 
obscured it. Sweating with terror, the Emperor put 
out his hand to seize the bell-rope, but some invisible 
being snatched it rudely from his grasp, and at the 
same instant the ominous shade vanished. </p>

<p>‘Pooh!’ exclaimed Napoleon, ‘it was but an 
ocular delusion.’ </p>

<p>‘Was it?’ whispered a hollow voice, in deep 
mysterious tones, close to his ear. ‘Was it a delusion, 
Emperor of France? No! all thou hast heard 
and seen is sad forewarning reality. Rise, lifter of 
the Eagle Standard! Awake, swayer of the Lily 
Sceptre! Follow me, Napoleon, and thou shalt 
see more.’ </p>

<p>As the voice ceased, a form dawned on his astonished sight. 
It was that of a tall, thin man, dressed 
in a blue surtout edged with gold lace. It wore a 
black cravat very tightly round its neck, and confined by 
two little sticks placed behind each ear. 
The countenance was livid; the tongue protruded 
from between the teeth, and the eyes all glazed and 
bloodshot started with frightful prominence from 
their sockets. </p>

<p>‘Mon Dieu!’ exclaimed the Emperor, ‘what do I 
see? Spectre, whence cometh thou?’ </p>

<p>The apparition spoke not, but gliding forward 
beckoned Napoleon with uplifted finger to follow. </p>

<p>Controlled by a mysterious influence, which deprived him 
of the capability of either thinking or 
acting for himself, he obeyed in silence. </p>

<p>The solid wall of the apartment fell open as they 
approached, and, when both had passed through, it 
closed behind them with a noise like thunder. </p>

<p>They would now have been in total darkness had 
it not been for a dim light which shone round the 
ghost and revealed the damp walls of a long, vaulted 
passage. Down this they proceeded with mute 
rapidity. Ere long a cool, refreshing breeze, which 
rushed wailing up the vault and caused the Emperor 
to wrap his loose nightdress closer round, announced 
their approach to the open air. </p>

<p>This they soon reached, and Nap found himself 
in one of the principal streets of Paris. </p>

<p>‘Worthy Spirit,’ said he, shivering in the chill 
night air, ‘permit me to return and put on some 
additional clothing. I will be with you again 
presently.’ </p>

<p>‘Forward,’ replied his companion sternly. </p>

<p>He felt compelled, in spite of the rising indignation which 
almost choked him, to obey. </p>

<p>On they went through the deserted streets till 
they arrived at a lofty house built on the banks of 
the Seine. Here the Spectre stopped, the gates 
rolled back to receive them, and they entered a large 
marble hall which was partly concealed by a curtain 
drawn across, through the half transparent folds of 
which a bright light might be seen burning with 
dazzling lustre. A row of fine female figures, richly 
attired, stood before this screen. They wore on 
their heads garlands of the most beautiful flowers, 
but their faces were concealed by ghastly masks 
representing death’s-heads. </p>

<p>‘What is all this mummery?’ cried the Emperor, 
making an effort to shake off the mental shackles by 
which he was so unwillingly restrained, ‘Where 
am I, and why have I been brought here?’ </p>

<p>‘Silence,’ said the guide, lolling out still further 
his black and bloody tongue. ‘Silence, if thou 
wouldst escape instant death.’ </p>

<p>The Emperor would have replied, his natural 
courage overcoming the temporary awe to which he 
had at first been subjected, but just then a strain 
of wild, supernatural music swelled behind the huge 
curtain, which waved to and fro, and bellied slowly 
out as if agitated by some internal commotion or 
battle of waving winds. At the same moment an 
overpowering mixture of the scents of mortal corruption, 
blent with the richest Eastern odours, stole 
through the haunted hall. </p>

<p>A murmur of many voices was now heard at a 
distance, and something grasped his arm eagerly 
from behind. </p>

<p>He turned hastily round. His eyes met the 
well-known countenance of Marie Louise. </p>

<p>‘What! are you in this infernal place, too?’ said 
he. ‘What has brought you here?’ </p>

<p>‘Will your Majesty permit me to ask the same 
question of yourself?’ said the Empress, smiling. </p>

<p>He made no reply; astonishment prevented him. 
No curtain now intervened between him and the 
light. It had been removed as if by magic, and a 
splendid chandelier appeared suspended over his 
head. Throngs of ladies, richly dressed, but without death’s-head 
masks, stood round, and a due proportion of gay 
cavaliers was mingled with them. Music was still 
sounding, but it was seen to proceed 
from a band of mortal musicians stationed in an 
orchestra near at hand. The air was yet redolent 
of incense, but it was incense unblended with stench. </p>

<p>‘Mon Dieu!’ cried the Emperor, ‘how is all this 
come about? Where in the world is Piche?’ </p>

<p>‘Piche?’ replied the Empress. ‘What does 
your Majesty mean? Had you not better leave 
the apartment and retire to rest?’ </p>

<p>‘Leave the apartment? Why, where am I?’ </p>

<p>‘In my private drawing-room, surrounded by a 
few particular persons of the Court whom I had 
invited this evening to a ball. You entered a few 
minutes since in your nightdress with your eyes 
fixed and wide open. I suppose from the astonishment you 
now testify that you were walking in your 
sleep.’ </p>

<p>The Emperor immediately fell into a fit of 
catalepsy, in which he continued during the whole 
of that night and the greater part of next day.</p>

<p class="title">THE TRAGEDY AND THE ESSAY </p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">One</span> wet and rainy afternoon Arthur was sitting 
alone in his room. The unfavourable weather, 
united to a severe headache the consequence of certain vigils 
of the previous night, indisposed him for 
serious study, and he sat toasting his feet at a bright 
fire and languidly turning over Vernet’s splendid 
views of the scenery round Verdopolis. </p>

<p>While thus employed, or rather indis-employed, 
in the vain endeavour to kill time, a servant entered 
and announced: ‘Mr. Hamilton.’ </p>

<p>‘Show him in,’ said Arthur with alacrity, glad of 
anything which might be likely to divert the tedious 
ennui which oppressed him. </p>

<p>As the young architect, who it is well known is 
one of my brother’s numerous toadies, appeared 
at the door, he rose and, offering him his hand, said 
with that winning air of condescension which has 
gained for him the hearts of the rising geniuses in 
Verdopolis: </p>

<p>‘Well, Edwin, how are you this suicidal day?’ </p>

<p>‘Quite well, my lord, I thank you. I trust I find 
your lordship the same?’ </p>

<p>As they seated themselves on a sofa the marquis 
replied: </p>

<p>‘I cannot say that I am very brisk this afternoon, 
I have a slight headache…’ </p>

<p>A brief silence followed of which Arthur seemed 
impatient, and he broke it by saying: </p>

<p>‘Now tell me, Edwin, what was your motive for 
coming to see me this dull day. I’m mistaken if 
you had not some particular reason.’ </p>

<p>‘Why, my lord,’ replied the architect, blushing 
and looking down with an embarrassed air, ‘I can’t 
deny that I have.’ </p>

<p>‘What is it, then?’ replied my brother eagerly. 
‘Have you been striking out some plan for a new 
public building? If so, let me see it directly.’ </p>

<p>‘No, my lord; my employment lately has been 
of another kind to that to which you allude. I have 
been wooing—’ </p>

<p>‘Wooing!’ interrupted the marquis. ‘What! 
you are going to be married, are you? Humph! 
I see it all now. On my conscience, it’s a perfect 
miracle how such a bashful fellow as you ever 
summoned courage to pop the question! But 
pray, what is the fair lady’s name?’ </p>

<p>‘Melpomene, the muse of tears!’ replied the 
modest Hamilton, blushing to the temples as he 
spoke. ‘In short, I’ve ventured hither to show 
your lordship a tragedy which I have written, 
called “Petus and Aria.”’</p>

<p>At these words the spirit of criticism began to 
sparkle in Arthur’s eye and the smile of sarcasm to 
curl his lip. Poor Hamilton shrunk together as he 
saw his patron gazing on him with that-cool, keen, 
composed aspect of contempt which he sometimes 
assumed in order to torture the wretches dependent 
on his favour. </p>

<p>‘A tragedy!’ he began. ‘Produce it by all 
means. But first tell me, Edwin, is it constructed 
in the Grecian or Gothic style of architecture? Or 
perhaps you may have invented a kind of composite 
order out of your own head?’ </p>

<p>‘Eh, my lord?’ murmured his hapless victim. </p>

<p>‘Petus and Aria,’ continued the unrelenting 
monster; ‘the former was, I believe, a somewhat 
timid and henpecked gentleman, whom for his 
arrant poltroonery I have always looked upon with 
supreme contempt; and the latter a strapping 
virago that showed herself particularly anxious to 
get her husband out of the world which he dishonoured. Queer 
materials these for a tragedy!’ </p>

<p>To his observations Hamilton’s only answer was a 
look of imploring agony. Its silent eloquence, however, 
touched Arthur more nearly than words would 
have done. He smiled and said in a more encouraging tone 
than he had hitherto used: </p>

<p>‘Come, Edwin, dismiss that miserable expression 
from your face and let us see this notable play.’ </p>

<p>With a trembling hand the architect drew the 
manuscript from his pocket and presented it to my 
brother. Half an hour of profound silence ensued, 
during which he continued to endure all the torments of 
suspense. At length the marquis laid it 
down, and the single word ‘Admirable!’ which 
escaped from his lips at once relieved Hamilton from 
a host of fears. </p>

<p>‘Are you in earnest, my lord?’ asked he. </p>

<p>‘Perfectly so; and as a proof of it I advise you 
to offer this play without loss of time to Mr. Price of 
the Theatre Royal. I will write a few lines in favour 
of it to him, and I do not doubt but that my recommendation 
will be sufficient to secure you handsome 
treatment in that quarter.’ </p>

<p>A fortnight passed. Rumours began to be rife 
through Verdopolis that Mr. Hamilton the architect, whose 
skill had long advanced him to the rank 
of rival to the celebrated Turner, had laid down the 
compasses and taken up the pen. Ere long these 
reports were confirmed by the appearance one 
Wednesday morning of Price’s bill of fare, containing 
the following announcement:— </p>

<p style="text-align: center; text-indent:0em; margin-bottom:0.5em; margin-top:0.5em; font-size:90%">This evening will be performed at the Theatre Royal <br>
PETUS AND ARIA, <br>
an entirely new tragedy by Edwin Hamilton, Esq., <br>
under the patronage of the Marquis of Douro. <br>
The character of Aria to be performed by Mrs. Siddons; <br>
that of Petus by Garry David. </p>

<p>That night Price had reason to lick his lips with 
satisfaction. Never before was there such a crowded 
house: pit, box, and gallery overflowed; and the 
manager after all expenses were paid netted a clear 
profit of five hundred pounds. </p>

<p>It was on this occasion that I took my station 
among the branches of the mighty golden chandelier 
which hangs from the centre of the dome; and from 
thence obtained a bird’s-eye view of the whole 
magnificent scene. </p>

<p>Certainly there are few sights more animated and 
inspiring than a crowded theatre. The brilliant 
lights, the ceaseless hum of voices, the busy and 
visionary stage, all conspire to raise indescribable 
feelings in the soul. More than a thousand of the 
loveliest women on earth sparkled in the dress circle, 
where the waving of plumes, the rustling of robes, 
and the light-bright eyes were perfectly dazzling. 
Among these my eyes singled out Lady Zenobia 
Ellrington. I noticed her particularly, because she 
seldom visits the theatre. There she sat robed in 
gorgeous purple, a star-light band of jewels gleaming 
among her rich raven locks. Lord Ellrington stood 
beside her in his usual plain black attire, and wearing 
a white cravat in the centre of which shone a single 
diamond. From my elevated station I beheld the 
entrance of Mr. Hamilton. The Marquis of Douro 
preceded him, accompanied by a beautiful girl in a 
white dress and green sash without any ornament on 
her head except a profusion of chestnut curls which, 
clustering in the most luxuriant ringlets, obliged her 
every now and then to raise her small hand in order 
to put them back from her snowy forehead and 
laughing blue eyes, which they almost concealed. 
I need not say that this was the marchioness. </p>

<p>Who shall describe the tumultuous rush of feelings 
which rose in Edwin’s bosom as he glanced hurriedly 
round at the vast assembly on which his fate this 
night depended. His eyes wildly wandered from 
the rough tenants of the gallery to the glittering 
population of the boxes, and finally fixed themselves on 
the mighty green curtain which still hung 
before the stage. The few moments that elapsed 
before its removal seemed to him an hour, but at 
last the tinkle of the prompter’s bell sounded and at 
once it was gathered to the ceiling. </p>

<p>The prologue (which had been furnished by 
Arthur) was received with thunders of applause, 
amidst which arose one solitary note of disapprobation. 
All eyes turned on the utterer of this presumptuous 
squeal, which was a small deformed thing 
of the ape kind dressed in a green coat, and bearing 
the name of Captain Andrew. </p>

<p>‘Knock him down!’ was the general cry of the 
gods in the gallery; which mandate was presently 
executed by my friend, John Bud, who stood near. 
The first scene now came on, in the course of 
which Mrs. Siddons displayed all her finest powers 
and even excelled herself. Peals of applause again 
shook the theatre to its foundations. Hamilton was 
scarcely able to contain the joy and gratitude which 
this intoxicating success excited. His cheeks glowed, 
his eye sparkled, and his frame trembled all over. 
His transports, however, were soon about to receive 
a fearful check. At the commencement of the 
second act Petus rushed into the tent of Camilus, 
exclaiming: ‘General, we breathe the air of death. 
Our plot is smoked!’ </p>

<p>‘Well,’ cried Lord Lofty, who with a bevy of 
puppies like himself occupied a box at no great 
distance; ‘Well, sir, and if your Pipe is smoked, 
can’t you light another?’ </p>

<p>The laughter of some of the audience was raised 
by this sally of miserable wit, which from what followed 
seemed to have been a preconcerted signal 
for an indiscriminate attack on the tragedy. The 
thread of approval being once broken it appeared 
impossible to reunite it. Hisses, groans, and peals 
of laughter now rose at the finest passages. The 
gods, who are ever ready to join in a tumult, without 
nicely inquiring into the cause, yelled aloud for the 
instant condemnation of the whole concern. Lofty 
and his gang joined them clamourosly in this 
demand, and at length the uproar rose to such a 
pitch that Mr. Price was compelled to come forward 
to the footlights and declare that since the audience 
disapproved of the play he consented to withdraw it. </p>

<p>‘All hope of fame is gone and I desire to live no 
longer,’ said Hamilton, turning on the marquis his 
corpse-like countenance. </p>

<p>‘Courage, Edwin,’ replied the latter. ‘It is part 
of my creed that there is no wound too deep to 
receive relief from the divine balsam of revenge. I 
know who is your principal foe, and if I live you 
shall enjoy the remedy in perfection.’ </p>

<br>

<p>It was a bright and lovely afternoon in the midst 
of autumn. The saloons of Waterloo Palace were 
thrown open for the admission of all the rank and 
fashion of Verdopolis. The doors of the great library 
were likewise unfolded, and there a knot of <i>bel-esprits</i>, 
the very flower of Africa’s geniuses, had 
gathered round a large open bow-window through 
which might be seen the extensive pleasure-grounds 
where groups of the brighter children of fashion 
roamed idly about or reposed under the shade of 
sequestered bowers. Of course my brother and 
Lady Zenobia Ellrington formed the nucleus round 
which this literary party had assembled. While 
they were conversing Lord Lofty entered and took 
his station near them. He could not actually join 
their party, because, though a man of considerable 
talent, he had never written a book, painted a 
picture, or moulded a statue; and it is an understood regulation 
of this chosen band that none but 
genuine authors and artists shall have the privilege 
of entering into their high and exclusive society. 
While he listened to the noble sentiment, the 
brilliant wit, the exhaustless knowledge, and the 
varied information which, clothed in the purest 
language and uttered in the soft subdued tones 
which perfect refinement dictates, formed a conversazione 
of such fascinating brilliancy as he had 
never heard before, undefined longings arose in his 
heart to become a more immediate partaker of the 
feast of reason and the flow of soul he witnessed. 
At this moment the Marchioness of Douro, who, 
seated on a low footstool at the feet of her husband 
and Lady Ellrington, had been gazing up at them 
with her large blue eyes full of wonder and delight, 
suddenly exclaimed in her usual artless manner: 
‘I wish I had written a book!’ </p>

<p>‘And so do I,’ was the response that immediately 
burst from Lofty’s lips. The marquis smiled at the 
characteristic simplicity of Marian’s aspiration; 
but he turned with a more serious air to Lofty, and 
said: </p>

<p>‘Well, and what is there to hinder you from 
writing as many books as you like?’ </p>

<p>‘Nothing, my lord, except that I have not the 
genius.’ </p>

<p>‘Pshaw! nonsense! you can do anything you 
choose!’ </p>

<p>‘Are you in earnest, Douro?’ </p>

<p>‘In earnest? Yes, that I am: I never was more 
so in my life.’ </p>

<p>‘Well, then, I really do think I’ll turn author.’ </p>

<p>‘That’s right, Fred. I’ll breakfast with you to-morrow 
morning, and we’ll talk the matter over at 
our leisure.’ </p>

<p>Next day Arthur was punctual to his appointment. On entering 
the breakfast-room he found 
Lord Frederic seated in a morning gown of green and 
silver brocade with slippers to correspond, and on 
the table beside him lay a quire of paper and an 
inkstand of elaborate workmanship with golden 
pens, etc. The smile with which he viewed these 
preparations would have undeceived any other than 
Lofty, whose faculties were rendered, however, so 
obtuse by conceit that he conceived it to be merely 
a token of approbation. </p>

<p>After the first cup or two of chocolate had been 
discussed the marquis entered upon business by 
saying: ‘Well, Fred, do you continue in the same 
mind I left you in last night?’ </p>

<p>‘Certainly, my lord; I am even confirmed in my 
determination to become an author. The only 
thing that puzzles me is on what subject to exercise that genius 
which you flatter me I possess.’ </p>

<p>After a moment’s silence and apparent consideration, Arthur 
said: </p>

<p>‘Of course you would desire something original. 
Talent like yours would not be content to follow in 
any beaten path.’ </p>

<p>‘Surely. In fact, I have determined that no 
hackneyed theme shall receive immortality from 
my pen. Now, Douro, could you not help me to 
one that has never been touched on before?’ </p>

<p>‘I think I could; but before I mention it let me 
briefly define to you the meaning of originality. It 
consists in raising from obscurity some theme, topic, 
employment, or existence which has never been 
thought of by the great mass of men, or thought of 
only to be despised; in pouring around it the light 
of genius, proving its claim to admiration by subtlety 
of logic, clothing it with all the bright tones of a 
lively imagination, and presenting it thus adorned 
to the astonished world. I counsel you, Fred, to 
take for your subject the unjustly condemned art of 
the laundress. Write an essay on it divided into 
three parts, viz.: washing, starching, and ironing. 
In the first, summon up all your learning. Go back 
to the old times of Homer when princesses bleached 
linen in the gardens of Adcinous. Trace the art 
through the ramifications of ages and nations down 
to the present day. Expatiate upon the purity of 
the employment; give it an allegorical meaning, 
and conclude by saying that it excels all others in 
dignity and honour. Let the second be a dissertation on 
the process of making starch. Point out 
the grain which is most proper for it, and launch a 
thundering anathema against all adulterators of the 
genuine article. In the third, discourse most excellent 
music on the different kinds of irons, as box-irons, 
flat-irons, and Italian irons, and mind you 
give them the preference over such machines as 
mangles and calenders. Do all this and I think I 
can promise you as the reward of your labours 
renown of such a nature and extent as would satisfy 
the ambition of most men.’ </p>

<p>‘My lord,’ replied Lofty, ‘by this disinterested 
and noble counsel you have conferred on me an 
eternal obligation. I will follow up the hint you 
have given, and by so doing I hope to produce 
somewhat that the gracious public will not willingly 
let die.’ </p>

<p>From that day Lord Lofty became an altered 
man. He was no longer the free, dashing, gallant 
young nobleman whose handsome exterior and high-bred manners 
endeared him to the fair sex, and 
whose superiority both mental and personal had 
entitled him to the rank of viceroy in the world of 
fashion, subject only to those two mighty monarchs, 
Douro and Ellrington. Seldom now was either ballroom, race 
ground, parliament house, rotunda, or 
ring honoured with his presence. Day and night 
he immersed himself in the solitude of his study and 
gave access to none but my brother, who urged him 
unrelentingly to the completion of the task which he 
had assigned him. Sometimes, indeed, the unhappy 
gull ventured forth to his old haunts, but so changed 
was he become in dress, language, and behaviour 
as scarcely to be recognised by his most intimate 
friends. A shabby black coat was generally wrapped 
round him; shoes trodden down at the heels garnished his 
feet; and the fair hair which formerly 
was his greatest pride, and which he usually wore 
arranged in clustering curls, now hung neglected in 
elf-locks round a countenance that for consumptive 
paleness and attenuation might have been envied 
by the veriest tea-taster in existence. His conversation 
was in unison with his appearance, whining, 
sickly, pedantic, and filled with that disgusting 
species of affectation peculiar to literary coxcombs. 
The consequence of this was that those who had 
been accustomed to consider his acquaintance as an 
honour and a matter of boasting now grew ashamed 
to be seen in company with him. When he entered 
a drawing-room the ladies turned aside their heads, 
and the gentlemen regarded him with a glance of 
undisguised contempt. Not a hand was stretched 
out to welcome him; not a voice repeated his name 
except in atone of derision. These things, however, 
he neither saw nor regarded. Fenced by a triple 
shield of self-conceit, the scorn of women and the 
disgust of men moved him no more than hailstones 
would a rock. </p>

<p>After some months of incessant labour he at 
length one evening announced to the marquis that 
his work was completed. </p>

<p>‘Wait till to-morrow, Fred,’ replied that faithful 
friend. ‘I will then accompany you to Sergeant 
Tree’s, and you shall taste the first sweets of 
authorship.’ </p>

<p>That night and the first hours of morning seemed 
to Lofty an age. As soon as breakfast was over he 
stationed himself at the window and continued impatiently 
looking out for Arthur’s appearance. At 
length about eleven o’clock a.m. he perceived him 
advancing with his usual stately tread up the street. 
Flinging open the sash he jumped out and ran to 
meet him. As they walked towards the great bookseller’s 
the marquis mentioned that he had invited a 
few friends to meet him there that morning, as he 
wished them to be spectators of Lofty’s triumph. 
The latter bowed and expressed his gratitude for 
what he considered to be another instance of my 
brother’s attachment to him. They now entered 
the shop. Above a hundred men of the highest rank 
were assembled there, including Castlereagh, Molyneux, Aberford, 
Beauclerk, Sidney, Russell, Howard, 
Morpeth, etc., and by himself, leaning against a 
pillar, was Hamilton the architect, his pale face and 
his usually downcast eyes glowing with uncommon 
ardour behind the marble slab which, supported on 
Ionic columns, forms the counter. Sergeant Tree 
was seated in an elevated armchair. To him Lofty 
immediately advanced and, presenting his manuscript, said 
in a loud and pompous tone of voice: </p>

<p>‘Look at that, sir, and tell me what you will give 
me for it.’ </p>

<p>Tree took out his spectacles, placed them with all 
imaginable tranquillity, and after reading the title-page 
and glancing over the body of the work returned it 
coolly to the washerwoman, saying in his 
quiet business-like manner: ‘This, my lord, is not 
in my way. You have probably mistaken me for 
Mrs. Bleachum, the washerwoman.’ </p>

<p>A peal of laughter from the noble bystanders 
accompanied these words. Lofty stood motionless 
a moment as if transfixed, then turned to the marquis with 
a look of speechless agony. Instead of the 
cloud of sympathetic sorrow he had expected to see 
brooding on his friend’s brow his eyes fell on a 
countenance illumined by a smile of arch, cold, 
triumphant, deep and devilish meaning. It pierced 
at once the thick veil of infatuation that obscured 
his-mental vision, and suddenly the light of truth 
burst on him with almost annihilating splendour. 
While he stood more like a statue than a living man 
Arthur advanced and said in a low and soft voice, 
but so distinct as to be heard by all present: </p>

<p>‘Well, Frederic, don’t you think a rejected essay 
is almost as agreeable as a condemned tragedy?’ </p>

<div class="ednote">
<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">Charlotte Brontë</span> was eighteen years of age when she 
wrote these descriptions of the principal characters in her 
stories. ‘The land of the Genii’ had become ‘The Kingdom 
of Angria’; the Duke of Wellington was almost 
forgotten; and her early hero, the Marquis of Douro, had 
received various other titles, including that of Duke of 
Zamorna, and had been elected King of Angria. He 
had developed a character totally different from that of 
the studious and ingenuous youth of Charlotte Brontë’s 
earlier stories. </p>

<p>At this time his first wife, Marian Hume, is supposed to 
have been dead several years, and he is married to Mary 
Henrietta, the daughter of his Prime Minister—Alexander 
Percy, Viscount Ellrington and Earl of Northangerland. </p>

<p>Alexander Percy (sometimes called Alexander Rogue) 
was originally a pirate, and was one of the creations 
of Charlotte’s brother, Patrick Branwell Brontë, when 
very young. On pp. 175-179 of <i>A Bibliography of the 
Writings in Prose and Verse of the Members of the Brontë 
Family</i>, 1917, by Thomas J. Wise, is printed a poem of 
one hundred and twenty-eight lines entitled ‘The Rover.’ 
This is a poem by Patrick Branwell Brontë descriptive of 
one of Alexander Percy’s adventures when he was a pirate. 
It was from this character that Branwell Brontë took the 
pseudonyms of ‘Northangerland’ and ‘Alexander Percy,’ 
which he continued to use until the end of his life. </p>

<p>The first wife of Northangerland also is dead at this time, 
and he is married to Lady Zenobia Ellrington, who in 
earlier stories (‘Albion and Marina,’ ‘The Rivals,’ and 
‘Love and Jealousy’) was the rival of Marian Hume for 
the affections of the Marquis of Douro. </p>

<p>General Thornton is the guardian of the young Lord 
Wellesley, the supposed author of the manuscript in which 
‘A Peep into a Picture Book’ was found. </p>

<p class="title">A PEEP INTO A PICTURE BOOK </p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">It</span> is a fine, warm, sultry day, just after dinner. I 
am at Thornton Hotel. The General is enjoying his 
customary nap; and while the serene evening sunshine reposes 
on his bland features and unruffled 
brow, an atmosphere of calm seems to pervade the 
apartment. </p>

<p>What shall I do to amuse myself? I dare not 
stir lest he should awake; and any disturbance of 
his slumbers at this moment might be productive of 
serious consequences to me: no circumstance would 
more effectually sour my landlord’s ordinarily bland 
temperament. Hark! There is a slight, light 
snore, most musical, most melancholy: he is firmly 
locked in the chains of the drowsy god. </p>

<p>At the opposite end of the room three large 
volumes that look like picture books lie on a sideboard; 
their green watered-silk quarto covers and 
gilt backs are tempting, and I will make an effort to 
gain possession of them. Softly, softly: there, I 
have thrown down a silver fruit knife and a piece of 
orange peel! He stirs! I must pause awhile or 
he will certainly awake. Hem! the worthy gentleman settles 
down to his former tranquillity; the 
incipient frown which contracted his forehead is 
past away; and the rest of a good conscience, the 
calm of a mental and corporeal healthiness, sleeps 
there again. </p>

<p>With zephyr-step and bosomed breath I glide 
onward to the sideboard, I seize my prize, and being 
once more safely established in my chair I open 
the volumes to see if the profit be equivalent to 
the pains. </p>

<p>Eureka! Eureka! ‘Tree’s Portrait Gallery of 
the Aristocracy of Africa’! Why, here is cent. 
per cent. indeed! The very thing; the beau-ideal 
of provision for an after-dinner’s amusement! 
However languid and unfitted for exertion, the 
veriest gourmand could not turn with disgust from 
such placid entertainment as is here prepared for 
him; the sleepiest eye might wander unwearied 
over the silent visions that here follow each other in 
a succession so dreamy and voiceless. </p>

<p>I am no gourmand after dinner; I am as active 
as before; but just now the pleasure of hanging over 
forms that speak without sound, of gazing into 
motionless eyes that search your very heart, is more 
attractive to me than sprightlier employments. </p>

<p>The second volume is nearest to my hand, and I 
will raise first from the shadow of gossamer paper, 
waving as I turn it like a web of woven air, the 
spirit whosoever it be, male or female, crowned or 
coroneted, that animates its frontispiece. </p>

<p>A mighty phantom has answered my spell: an awful 
shape clouds the magic mirror! Reader, before me 
I behold the earthly tabernacle of Northangerland’s 
unsounded soul! There he stands: what a vessel 
to be moulded from the coarse clay of mortality! 
What a plant to spring from the rank soil of human 
existence! And the vessel is without flaw: polished, 
fresh, and bright from the last process of the maker. 
The flower has sprung up to mature beauty, but not 
a leaf is curled, not a blossom faded. This portrait 
was taken ere the lights and shadows of twenty-five 
summers had fallen across the wondrous labyrinth 
of Percy’s path through life. At this moment a 
gleam of sunlight, real deep gold in hue, comes 
through the kindled window-panes, and falls richly 
and serenely on the picture. It is a softened glory, 
for the sun is far west and its amber rays shed 
inexpressible tranquillity wherever they descend. 
How sweetly they sleep on that brow! and on 
those Ionic features! Percy! Percy! never was 
humanity fashioned in a fairer mould. The eye 
follows delighted all those classic lines of face and 
form: not one unseemly curvature or angle to 
disturb the general effect of so much refined regularity; 
all appears carved in ivory. The grossness 
of flesh and blood will not suit its statuesque exactness 
and speckless polish. A feeling of fascination 
comes over me while I gaze on that Phidian nose 
defined with such beautiful precision; that chin 
and mouth chiselled to such elaborate perfection; 
that high, pale forehead, not bald as now, but yet 
not shadowed with curls, for the clustering hair is 
parted back, gathered in abundant wreaths on the 
temples and leaving the brow free for all the gloom 
and glory of a mind that has no parallel to play over 
the expanse of living marble which its absence 
reveals. The expression in this picture is somewhat pensive, 
composed, free from sarcasm except 
the fixed sneer of the-lip and the strange deadly 
glitter of the eye whose glance—a mixture of the 
keenest scorn and deepest thought—curdles the 
spectator’s blood to ice. In my opinion this head 
embodies the most vivid ideas we can conceive of 
Lucifer, the rebellious archangel: there is such a 
total absence of human feeling and sympathy; such 
a cold frozen pride; such a fathomless power of 
intellect; such passionless yet perfect beauty—not 
breathing and burning, full of tightening blood and 
fiery thought and feeling like that of some others 
whom our readers will recollect,—but severely 
studied, faultlessly refined, as cold and hard and 
polished and perfect as the most priceless brilliant. 
And in his eye there is a shade of something, words 
cannot express what. The sight may catch, but not 
fix it. A gleam, scarcely human, dark and fiend-like, it 
steals away under the lash, quivers sometimes 
with the mysterious tremor of a northern 
light, fixes stedfastly on some luckless bystander, 
who shrinks from the supernatural aspect, and then 
is all at once quenched. Once that marvellous light 
fell on me; and long after I beheld it vanish its 
memory haunted me like a spirit. The sensation 
which it excited was very singular. I felt as if he 
could read my soul; and strange to tell there was no 
fear lest he should find sinful thoughts and recollections 
there, but a harassing dread lest anything good 
might arise which would awake the tremendous 
power of sarcasm that I saw lurking in every feature 
of his face. Northangerland has a black drop in his 
veins that flows through every vessel, taints every 
limb, stagnates round his heart, and there in the 
very citadel of life the albinous blood of the patrician 
is the bitterest, rankest gall. Let us leave him in that 
shape, ‘bright with beauty, dark with crime.’ He 
has sailed over many seas, wandered in many lands; 
just so with that look buried in profound meditation 
I can imagine him pacing the silent quarter-deck of 
his own <i>Red Rover</i>, his eyes fixed on the sullen sea 
that moans round him on every side, watching the 
mighty plunges of the waves rushing on as if they 
had an aim in their journey, as if they would 
bound on before his gallant ship, and were seeking the land 
she sought with emulous intent to 
outstrip the wanderer of their green wilderness, and 
to teach her that ocean would not brook her haughty 
defiance. Farewell, Percy! </p>

<p>I turn the leaves and behold—his countess! </p>

<p>Hum! hum! I am not on very good terms with 
this celebrated lady, as all the world knows; yet 
plain truth compels me to confess that she is a very 
fine woman, a superb daughter of Verdopolis; and 
Frederick de Lisle has done her justice; so has 
Edward Findan. A mere blue ought not to be so 
handsome. What eyes! What raven hair! What 
an imposing contour of form and countenance! </p>

<p>She is perfectly grand in her velvet robes, dark 
plume, and crown-like turban. The lady of Ellrington House, 
the wife of Northangerland, the prima 
donna of the Angrian Court, the most learned 
woman of her age, the modern Cleopatra, the Verdopolitan 
de Staël: in a word, Zenobia Percy! Who 
would think that that grand form of feminine 
majesty could launch out into the unbridled excesses of 
passion in which her ladyship not unfrequently 
indulges? There is fire in her eyes, and 
command on her brow; and some touch of a pride 
that would spurn restraint in the curl of her rich lip. 
But all is so tempered with womanly dignity that it 
would seem as if neither fire nor pride nor imperiousness 
could awaken the towering fits of ungoverned 
and frantic rage that often deform her beauty. 
Her hands, look at them, they are well formed and 
small, white and sparkling with rings; is it natural 
that such hands should inflict the blows that sometimes 
tingle from them? I think not; but my 
scarlet ears and aching bones have more than once 
borne incontestable witness how the case stands! 
The truth is her fingers though slender are long and 
like those of Zamorna, and like his they possess 
more vigour than their fragile structure would seem 
to indicate. She can spar, I verily believe, with her 
own husband, one of the best boxers on record, 
though now a little disabled by a tormenting complaint from 
long-continued exertion. Her employment, however, 
as here represented is of a higher 
order than pugilistic achievement. She leans on a 
large clasped volume, another of equal size lies open 
before her, and: one taper forefinger directs the 
spectator’s attention to the page while her eye looks 
into his with an earnest and solemn air as if she were 
warning him of the mighty treasures contained in 
the maxims of ancient lore to which she points. As 
I turn from this pictured representation of the 
countess I must say she is a noble creature both in 
mind and body, though full of the blackest defects: 
a flawed diamond; a magnificent landscape trenched 
with drains; virgin gold basely adulterated with 
brass; a beautiful intellectual woman, but an infidel. </p>

<p>The next portrait is that of His Grace the Duke of 
Fidena. I feel as if awaking from a feverish dream, 
a distempered vision of troubled grandeur and 
stormy glory, as I raise my eyes from the lord and 
lady of Pandemonium, from Sin and Satan, and let 
them fall on Prince John, the Royal Philosopher. 
How grave! what severe virtue! what deep and 
far-sought and well-treasured wisdom! what inflexible uprightness! 
Integrity that Death could 
not turn from the path of right; Firmness that 
would stoop to the block rather than yield one jot 
of its just, mature, righteous resolution; Truth 
from which the agonies of the wheel would be powerless to 
wring a word of equivocation; and to speak 
verity, Pride that could no more be thawed than 
the icebergs of Greenland or the snows of his own 
Highland hills. There is a look too of prejudice in 
his rather stern forehead, a something which tells us 
that Fidena could be an unforgiving, almost a 
vindictive, enemy, if stubbornly opposed or wantonly insulted. 
An air of reserve, of stiffness, which 
warns us that the son of Alexander,—all good, wise, 
and just, as he is,—lays emphasis on the forms of 
Courts, the usages of high circles. He will brook no 
breach of them, however trivial, in those under his 
authority. That cold eye and aristocratic mien say 
that jealousy would be quickly aroused by any 
mingling of ranks, any inroads of plebeians on the 
rights of patricians, any removing of landmarks or 
undermining of old institutions. He looks chill, 
almost forbidding. Something like a cold feeling of 
restraint creeps over us whilst we gaze: the virtues 
pictured in his stately features seem of that high 
and holy order which almost exempt their possessor 
from sympathy with mankind. Thoughts of martyrs 
or patriots, a zealous but stern prophet chosen in 
evil times to denounce judgment, not to proclaim 
mercy, recur to our minds. Yet John is not 
altogether what he appears; or rather he is that 
and more too. I have seen him in private life in 
moments of relaxation when surrounded by his 
family and one or two bosom friends. Nothing in 
such circumstances can be more fascinating than 
his winning, easy manner, his calm cheerfulness, his 
pleasing, philosophical gravity of aspect and demeanour. 
For hours I have watched him while he sat on 
a sofa with his lovely wife beside him, and the 
beautiful Marchioness of Douro sitting at his feet; 
and heard the benignant simplicity with which he 
poured out the stores of his varied and extensive 
erudition, answering so kindly and familiarly each 
question of the fair listeners, mingling an air of 
conjugal tenderness in his manner to his wife, and 
earnest melancholy gentleness in that to Marian 
such as always characterized his treatment of her. 
Poor thing! she looked on him as her only friend,—her 
brother, her adviser, her unerring oracle; with 
the warm devotedness that marked her disposition 
she followed his advice as if it had been the precept 
of inspired revelation. Fidena could not err; he 
could neither think nor act wrongly: he was 
perfect. Those who thought him too proud were 
very much mistaken. <i>She</i> never found him so. 
Nobody had milder and softer manners; nobody 
spoke more pleasantly. Thus she would talk; 
then blush with anger if any one contradicted her 
too exclusively favourable opinion. Prince John, I 
believe, regarded Marian as a delicate flower planted 
in a stormy situation; as a lovely, fragile being 
that needed his careful protection; and that protection 
he would have extended to her at the hazard 
of life itself. To the last he tried to support her. 
Many lone days he spent in watching and cheering 
her during her final lingering sickness; but all the 
kindness, all the tenderness in the world were insufficient 
to raise that blighted lily so long as the 
sunshine of those eyes which had been her idolatry was 
withered; and so long as the music of that voice she 
had loved so fondly and truly sounded too far off to 
be heard. Fidena was in the house when she died. 
He had left the chamber but a few minutes before 
Zamorna entered it. On quitting the bedside, as he 
hung over his adopted sister for the last time, a 
single large tear, the only one anguish, bodily or 
mental, ever wrung from the exalted soul of the 
Christian philosopher, dropped on the little worn 
hand he held in his; and he muttered half aloud: 
‘Would to God I had possessed this treasure; it 
should not thus have been thrown away.’ </p>

<p>Marian’s portrait comes next to Fidena. Every 
one know what it is like: the small delicate features, 
dark blue eyes full of wild and tender enthusiasm, 
beautiful curls, and frail-looking form, are familiar to 
all; so I need not pause on a more elaborate detail. </p>

<p>After her the frank face of General Thornton looks 
out on the gazer with a hearty, welcoming aspect. 
You almost hear his doric accents exclaiming: 
‘Well, how do you do, this evening? Fine, 
summer weather! I’m taking a bit of a stroll to 
Girnington Hall. Will ye come with me and see 
how the cattle thrive?’ Honest, honest Thornton! 
there are few men so worthy as thyself in the world. 
Thou hast been wronged, vilely and shamefully 
wronged; yet not a shadow of discontent in that 
smooth, broad brow, with its dashing swirl of hair, 
intimates that thou art an ill-used man. Never did 
a word of complaint fall from those fresh-coloured, 
well-formed lips. Hearty execrations have often 
poured from them, but not a single whine. Thornton bears 
a resemblance to Prince John; faint 
indeed and rather uncertain as to its locality, but 
still sufficient to point out their relationship. The 
complexions of both are fair and northern; the eyes 
are of similar colour: a clear and lively grey; and 
the nose not unlike in contour. Their forms, however, are 
very different, the general’s being middle-sized and 
somewhat stout, the duke’s tall, thin, and 
stately. But their minds! There the great distinction lies; 
no wonder they hate each other! Fire 
and flint could no more amalgamate than them. </p>

<p>Lady Maria Sneachy, a real, dazzling, brilliant, 
smiling beauty! What large, imperial eyes; what 
a magnificent neck and brow; and how haughtily 
she lifts her fair head with its weight of glancing 
black ringlets! She seems to scorn the earth which 
her small foot presses, and to look round in supreme 
contempt of beggarly man and all his trifling concerns. 
He may gaze at her, worship her, but let him 
aspire no higher. The laugh of satire that can burst 
from those lips is cutting to the last degree. I have 
seen many a wretch writhing under it, and pitied the 
despair with which he turned away from the royal 
coquette to seek happiness in a less splendid and less 
disdainful form. People say that Maria has found 
her tamer now. I know not how that is, but I think 
the King of Angria is too well satisfied with his 
present Queen, who fits herself to him and all his 
proud strange ways more perfectly every day, to 
choose even so grand a successor as Maria Sneachy 
would be. </p>

<p>Augustus, Marquis of Rosendale—young Highland 
Red-Deer! Fidena may be proud of his son. 
I never saw a child who better merited the epithet, 
‘handsome,’ than does this juvenile prince. All his 
limbs and features are so round and regular. Look 
at those fleshy, plump arms naked to the shoulder; 
on that fair and florid face with its fearless blue eye, 
and the curly grace of his plentiful light hair; on 
that bold white forehead which will be bared yet to 
the mountain winds of his fatherland when he 
fronts them in the storm of the chase, and to the 
keener gales of war when he follows the sound of 
the trumpet and charges either to the rescue or 
ruin of that banner whose orb is rising, but which 
ere then will be in its glowing noontide. Prince 
John should watch Augustus; let him not follow 
his young god-father in infancy or he will do it 
hereafter in manhood. </p>

<p>Here the second volume closes. I now take up 
the first. </p>

<p>Fire! Light! What have we here? Zamorna’s 
self, blazing in the frontispiece like the sun on his 
own standard. De Lisle has given him to us in full 
regimentals—plumed, epauletted, and sabred (I 
wish the last were literally true, by-the-bye!). All 
his usual insufferableness or irresistibleness, or whatever 
the ladies choose to call it, surrounding him like 
an atmosphere, he stands as if a thunderbolt could 
neither blast the light of his eyes nor dash the 
effrontery of his brow. Keen, glorious being! 
tempered and bright and sharp and rapid as the 
scimitar at his side when whirled by the delicate 
yet vigorous hand that now grasps the bridle of a 
horse to all appearance as viciously beautiful as himself. 
O Zamorna! what eyes those are glancing 
under the deep shadow of that raven crest! They 
bode no good. Man nor woman could ever gather 
more than a troubled, fitful happiness from their 
kindest light, Satan gave them their glory to 
deepen the midnight gloom that always follows 
where their lustre has fallen most lovingly. This, 
indeed, is something different from Percy. All here 
is passion and fire unquenchable. Impetuous sin, 
stormy pride, diving and soaring enthusiasm, war 
and poetry, are kindling their fires in all his veins, 
and his wild blood boils from his heart and back 
again like a torrent of new-sprung lava. Young 
duke? Young demon! I have looked at you till 
words seemed to issue from your lips in those fine 
electric tones, as clear and profound as the silver 
chords of a harp, which steal affections like a charm. 
I think I see him bending his head to speak to the 
Countess Zenobia or the Princess Maria or Lady 
Julia or perhaps Queen Henrietta, while he whispers 
words that touch the heart like a ‘melody that’s 
sweetly played in tune.’ A low wind rises and sighs 
slowly onward. Suddenly his plumes rustle; their 
haughty shadow sweeps over his forehead; the eye,
—the full, dark, refulgent eye,—lightens most 
gloriously; his curls are all stirred; smiles dawn on 
his lip. Suddenly he lifts his head, flings back the 
feathers, and clusters of bright hair, and, while he 
stands erect and god-like, his regards (as the French 
say) bent on the lady, whoever it be, who by this 
time is of course seriously debating whether he be 
man or angel, a momentary play of indescribable 
expression round the mouth, and elevation of the 
eyebrows, tell how the stream of thought runs at 
that moment; the mind which so noble a form 
enshrines! Detestable wretch!—I hate him! </p>

<p>But just opposite, separated only by a transparent sheet 
of silver paper, there is something 
different: his wife, his own matchless Henrietta! 
She looks at him with serene eyes as if the dew of 
placid thought could be shed on him by the influence 
of those large, clear stars. It reminds me of moonlight 
descending on troubled waters. I wish the 
parallel held good all the way, and that she was as 
far beyond the reach of sorrows arising from her 
husband’s insatiable ambition and fiery impetuosity 
as Dian is above the lash of the restless deep. But 
it is not so: her destiny is linked with his; and 
however strange the great river of Zamorna’s fate 
may flow; however awful the rapids over which it 
may rush; however cold and barren the banks of 
its channel; however wild, however darkly beached 
and stormily billowed the ocean into which it may 
finally plunge, Mary’s must follow. Fair creature! 
I could weep to think of it. For her sake, I hope a 
bright futurity for her lord; pity that the shadow of 
grief should ever fall where the light of such beauty 
shines. Every one knows how like the duchess is 
to her father: his very image cast in a softer—it 
could not be a more refined—mould. They are 
precisely similar, even to the very delicacy of their 
hands. As Byron says, her features have all the 
statuesque repose, the calm classic grace, that dwells 
on the Earl’s. She, however, has one advantage 
over him: the stealing, pensive brilliancy of her 
hazel eyes, and the peaceful sweetness of her mouth, 
impart a harmony to the whole which the satanic 
sneer fixed on the corresponding features of Northangerland’s 
face totally destroys. The original 
paintings of these two engraved portraits, namely, 
Zamorna’s and his lady’s, hang in the grand refectory at 
Wellesley House. Five hundred guineas 
was the sum paid for each. They are de Lisle’s, and 
rank amongst his most splendid <i>chefs-d’œuvre</i>. I 
know of no parallels to them, except those of Percy 
and Zenobia in the central saloon at Ellrington Hall. 
Search all the world from Iceland to Australia, and 
you will not find four human beings, male and 
female, to compare with them. </p>

<p>Hector Mirabeau Montmorency, Esq.! These 
features are somewhat stern to gaze on after such a 
continuation of the beautiful. They are far, however, from 
being harsh and disagreeable. A great 
deal of stuff was written some years ago about the 
exaggerated and grotesque character of this gentleman’s 
physiognomy. I remember several libellous 
assertions to that effect in the long since exploded 
catch-penny of Captain Tree’s denominated: ‘The 
Foundling.’<sup><a id="note8text"></a><a href="#note8">*</a></sup> But, indeed, where all the rest was 
a compound of the grossest falsehood, where Lord 
and Lady Ellrington, Mr. Sydney, the Duke of 
Wellington, the whole concern of the Philosopher’s 
Island,—tutors, masters of colleges, students and 
all,—were hashed up into one wild farrago of bombast, 
fustian and lies, why should the Lord of 
Derrinane escape more than others? It is not to be 
wondered at that this same work, which gave a 
detailed account of Zenobia Percy’s declaring in 
solemn soliloquy that she hated her husband—abhorred, 
loathed, detested her own Alexander—which 
afterwards showed her daring him in the most 
insolent language to his fate, glorifying the young 
Marquis of Douro, and anathematizing <i>him</i>; and 
which, to crown all, made Percy offer to commit an 
act that certainly was more than excusable—almost 
justifiable after such provocation,—namely, the 
final settling of so shrewish and shameless a wife, 
introduced a third person to prevent the deed, and 
made his interference successful. The volume which 
contained all this, I say, should excite but small 
accession of wonder by the few lines that describe 
Montmorency as a broad, low man, bandy-legged, 
squinting, his head covered with a shock of shaggy 
black hair, and his eyes of the consistency of boiled 
gooseberries: green, glassy, and ghost-like. The 
fact is Hector is a tall, well-proportioned, robust 
figure, with red hair, a florid complexion, an expression 
of eye which indicates good humour, powerful 
talent, and no small degree of ferocity. His countenance 
is certainly not so femininely elegant as that 
of Northangerland, nor so fierily magnificent as 
that of Zamorna, but it is the countenance of a 
gentleman and a Glass-towner, not of a brownie 
and a bear. </p>

<p>Hist! Thornton is awakening! </p>

<p>‘Heigho, Charles, what are ye about there?’ </p>

<p>‘Looking at pictures.’ </p>

<p>‘Looking at pictures? Aye, that ye are with 
a vengeance! Do ye see what you’ve done? 
Daubed your hands with ink, and then rubbed them 
over every other portrait in the book. Well, child, 
thou dost try my patience! Take away your 
fingers this minute. There! he’s drawn a scrawl 
across Lady Julia Sydney’s bonny face and spoiled 
the handsomest lass in the book! Leave the room 
and get me <i>The Cook’s Guide</i>: you shall learn a page 
of recipes for this business before ever you have a 
morsel of supper. Poor Julia! she’s fairly changed 
into a blackamoor; and there’s John with an ink 
mark across his forehead that makes him frown like 
death. Faith, that was a lucky hit! I’ve a’most 
a good mind to forgive you for it; but I willn’t 
either: there’s a hundred pounds thrown away, and 
I won’t have such work.’ </p>

<p>All this was very true. While examining the 
portraits I had been jotting down the few remarks 
here contained. The ink had been communicated 
by the pen to my fingers, and by them to each leaf 
as I turned it over. If crime can be expiated by 
punishment, however, my sin was soon washed away. 
Till ten o’clock that night I was engaged in lifting 
up my voice over the pathetic pages of <i>The Cook’s 
Guide, or, Every Man his own Housekeeper</i>—(I think 
that is the title of the abomination); and, let me 
assure the reader, such a penalty as this might be 
the guerdon of graver guilt. </p>

<p class="title">MINA LAURY </p>

<h3>I </h3>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">The</span> Cross of Rivaulx!<sup><a id="note9text"></a><a href="#note9">*</a></sup> Is that a name familiar to 
my readers? I rather think not. Listen, then. It 
is a green, delightful, and quiet place, half way 
between Angria and the foot of the Sydenham Hills, 
under the frown of Hawkscliffe, and on the edge of 
its royal forest. You see a fair house whose sash-windows 
are set in ivy grown thick and kept in trim 
order. Over the front door there is a little porch 
of trellis-work, all the summer covered with a succession 
of verdant leaves and pink roses: globes, 
buds, and full-blown blossoms. Within this in fine 
weather the door is constantly open and reveals a 
passage terminating in a staircase of low white steps 
traced up the middle by a brilliant carpet. There 
are no decided grounds laid out about the Cross of 
Rivaulx; but a lawn-like greenness surrounds it, 
and the last remnants of Hawkscliffe shade it in the 
form of many wild-rose trees and a few lofty elms. 
You look in vain for anything like a wall or gate to 
shut it in. The only landmark consists in an old 
obelisk with moss and wild-flowers at its base and 
a half-obliterated crucifix sculptured on its side. 
Well, this is no very presuming place, but on a June 
evening not seldom have I seen a figure whom 
every eye in Angria might recognise stride out of 
the domestic gloom of that little hall and stand in 
pleasant leisure under the porch whose flowers and 
leaves were disturbed by the contact of his curls. It 
is but a lodge to the mighty towers of Hawkscliffe, 
which being five miles distant buried in the chase are 
of less convenient access. The day is breezeless, 
quite still and warm. The sun far declined, for 
afternoon is just melting into evening, sheds a deep 
amber light. A cheerful air surrounds the mansion, 
whose windows are up, its door as usual hospitably 
apart; and the broad passage reverberates with a 
lively conversational hum from the rooms which 
open upon it. The day is of that perfectly mild, 
sunny kind that by an irresistible influence draws 
people out into the balmy air; and see, there are 
two gentlemen lounging easily in the porch sipping 
coffee from the cups they have brought from the 
drawing-room, and a third has stretched himself on 
the soft moss in the shadow of the obelisk. But 
for these figures the landscape would be one of 
exquisite repose. They break the enchantment of 
sun, sky, pleasant home, and waveless trees. Their 
dress is military: they are officers from Angria, 
from the headquarters of Zamorna’s grand army. 
Two at least are of this description. The other, 
reclining on the grass, a slight figure in black, wears 
a civil dress. That is Mr. Warner, the Home Secretary. Another 
person was standing by him, whom 
I should not have omitted to describe. It was a fine 
girl dressed in rich black satin with ornaments like 
those of a bandit’s wife, in which a whole fortune 
seemed to have been expended; but no wonder, for 
they had doubtless been the gifts of a king! In her 
ears (she was not too refined for the barbaric magnificence 
of earrings) hung two long clear drops red as 
fire and suffused with a purple tint that showed 
them to be the true oriental ruby. Bright, delicate links 
of gold circled her neck again and again; 
and a cross of gems lay on her breast, the centre 
stone of which was a locket enclosing a ringlet of 
dark brown hair. With that little soft curl she 
would not have parted for a kingdom. </p>

<p>Warner’s eyes were fixed with interest on Miss 
Laury as she stood over him, a model of beautiful 
vigour and glowing health, a kind of military erectness 
in her form so elegantly built, and in the 
manner in which her neck sprung from her bust and 
was placed with graceful uprightness on her falling 
shoulders. Her waist too falling in behind, and her 
fine slender foot supporting her in a regulated position, 
plainly indicated familiarity from her childhood with 
the sergeants’ drill. </p>

<p>All the afternoon she had been entertaining: her 
exalted guests,—the two in the porch were no other 
than Lord Hartford and Enara,<sup><a id="note10text"></a><a href="#note10">*</a></sup> and conversing 
with them frankly and cheerfully, but with a total 
absence of levity, a dash of seriousness, an habitual 
intentness of purpose that had more than once 
attracted to her the admiring glance of the Home 
Secretary. These and Lord Arundel were the only 
friends she had in the world. Female acquaintance 
she never sought, nor if she had sought would she 
have found them. And so sagacious, clever, and 
earnest was she in all she said and did that the 
haughty aristocrats did not hesitate to communicate with 
her often on matters of first-rate importance. 
Mr. Warner was now talking to her about 
himself. </p>

<p>‘My dear madam,’ he was saying in his imperious 
but still dulcet tone, ‘it is unreasonable that you 
should remain thus exposed to danger. I am your 
friend; yes, madam, your true friend. Why do 
you not hear me and attend to my representations 
of the case? Angria is an unsafe place for you; 
you ought to leave it.’ </p>

<p>The lady shook her head: ‘Never till my master 
compels me; his land is my land.’ </p>

<p>‘But—but, Miss Laury, you know that our army 
has no warrant from the Almighty of conquest. 
This invasion may be successful, at least for a time, 
and then what becomes of you? When the duke’s 
nation is wrestling with destruction, his glory sunk 
in deep waters, and himself diving desperately to 
recover it, can he waste a thought or a moment on 
a woman? You will be at the tender mercies 
of Quashia,<sup><a id="note11text"></a><a href="#note11">*</a></sup> and of Sheik Medina,—I mean of 
the detestable renegade Gordon,—before you are 
aware.’ </p>

<p>Mina smiled. ‘I am resolved,’ said she. ‘My 
master himself shall not force me to leave him. You 
know I am hardened, Warner; shame and reproach 
have no effect on me. I do not care for being called 
a camp-follower. In peace and pleasure all the 
ladies in Africa would be at the duke’s beck; in 
war and suffering he shall not lack one poor peasant 
girl. Why, sir, I’ve nothing else to exist for; I’ve 
no other interest in life. Just to stand by His Grace 
and watch him and anticipate his wishes, or when 
I cannot do that to execute them like lightning 
when they are signified; to wait on him when he is 
sick or wounded, to hear his groans and bear his 
heartrending animal-patience in enduring pain; to 
breathe if I can my own inexhaustible health and 
energy into him; and oh! if it were practicable, to 
take his fever and agony, to guard his interests, to 
take on my shoulders power from him that galls me 
with its weight; to fill gaps in his mighty train of 
service that nobody else would dare to step into; 
to do all that, sir, is to fulfil the destiny I was born 
to. I know I am of no repute among society at 
large, because I have devoted myself so wholly to 
one man. And I know that he very seldom troubles 
himself to think of what I do; and has never and 
can never appreciate the unusual feelings of subservience, 
the total self-sacrifice I offer at his shrine. 
But then he gives me my reward, and that an 
abundant one. Mr. Warner, when I was at Fort 
Adrian and had all the yoke of governing the garrison and 
military household I used to rejoice in my 
responsibility and to feel firmer the heavier the 
weight was assigned me to support. And when my 
master came over, as he often did, to take one of his 
general surveys, or on a hunting expedition with 
some of you, his officers, I had such delights in 
ordering the banquets and entertainments and in 
seeing the fires kindled up and chandeliers lighted in 
those dark halls, knowing for whom the feast was 
made ready; and it gave me a feeling of ecstasy to 
hear my young master’s voice as he spoke to you or 
Arundel or to that stately Hartford, and to see him 
moving about secure and powerful in his own stronghold, 
to know what true hearts he had about him, 
assured as I was that his generals and ministers were 
men of steel, and that his vassals under my rule were 
trusty as the very ramparts they garrisoned. The 
last summer evening that he came here the sun and 
flowers and quietness brightened his noble features 
with such happiness I could tell his heart was at 
rest, for as he lay in the shade where you are now 
I heard him hum the airs he long ago played on his 
guitar at Mornington. I was rewarded then to feel 
that the house I kept was pleasant enough to make 
him forget Angria, and recur to home. The west, 
the sweet west, is both his home and mine.’ </p>

<p>Mina paused and looked solemnly at the sun now 
softened in its shine and hanging exceedingly low. 
In a moment her eyes fell again on Warner. They 
seemed to have absorbed radiance from what they 
had gazed on. Light like an arrow-point glanced 
in them as she said: </p>

<p>‘This is my time to follow. Ill not be robbed of 
those hours of blissful danger when I may be continually 
with him. My kind, noble master never 
likes to see my tears, and I will weep before him 
night and day till he grants what I wish. I am not 
afraid of danger. I have strong nerves. I don’t 
wish to fight like an Amazon; and fatigue I never 
felt. I will die or be with him.’ </p>

<p>‘What has fired your eyes so suddenly, Miss 
Laury?’ asked Lord Hartford, now advancing with 
Enara from their canopy of roses. </p>

<p>‘The duke, the duke,’ muttered Henri Fernando; 
‘she won’t leave him, I’ll be sworn.’ </p>

<p>‘I can’t, general,’ said Mina. </p>

<p>‘No,’ answered the Italian; ‘and nobody shall 
force you. You shall have your own way, madam, 
whether it be right or wrong.’ </p>

<p>Before Miss Laury could answer a voice from 
within the mansion spoke her name. </p>

<p>‘It is my lord!’ she exclaimed, and ran over the 
sward, through the porch, along the passage, to a 
summer parlour whose walls were painted a fine pale 
red, its mouldings burnished gilding, and its window-curtains 
artistical draperies of dark blue silk covered 
with gold waves and flowers. Here Zamorna sat 
alone. He had been writing. One or two letters, 
folded, sealed, and inscribed with western directions, lay 
on the table beside him. His gloves and 
cambric handkerchief with a crown wrought upon it 
in black hair appeared on his desk. He had not uncovered 
since entering the house three hours since; 
and either the weight of his dragoon helmet or the 
gloom of its impending plumes or else some inward 
feeling had clouded his face with a strange darkness. 
Mina closed the door and softly drew near. Without speaking 
or asking leave she began to busy herself in 
unclasping the heavy helmet. The duke 
smiled faintly as her little fingers played about his 
chin and luxuriant whiskers, and then, the load of 
brass and sable plumage being removed, as they 
arranged the pressed masses of glossy brown ringlets and 
touched with soft cool contact his feverish 
brow. Absorbed in the grateful task she hardly 
felt that His Majesty’s arm had encircled her waist, 
and yet she did feel it too and would have thought 
herself presumptuous to shrink from the endearment. 
She took it as a slave ought to take the caress of a 
Sultan, and obeying the gentle effort of his hand 
slowly sank on to the sofa by her master’s side. </p>

<p>‘My little physician,’ said he, meeting her adoring 
but anxious upward gaze with the full light of his 
countenance, ‘you look at me as if you thought I 
was not well. Feel my pulse.’ </p>

<p>She folded that offered hand, white, supple, and 
soft with youth and delicate nature, in both her own, 
and whether Zamorna’s pulse beat rapidly or not 
his handmaid’s did as she felt the slender grasping 
fingers of the monarch laid quietly in hers. He did 
not wait for the report, but took his hand away again, 
and laying it on her raven curls said: </p>

<p>‘So, Mina, you won’t leave me though I never did 
you any good in the world? Warner says you are 
resolved to continue in the scene of war.’ </p>

<p>‘To continue by your side, my lord.’ </p>

<p>‘But what shall I do with you, Mina? Where 
shall I put you? My little girl, what will the army 
say when they hear of your presence? You have 
read history? Recollect that it was Darius who 
carried his concubines to the field, not Alexander! 
The world will say: “Zamorna attends to his own 
pleasures and cares not how his men suffer.”’ </p>

<p>Mina writhed at these words as if the iron had 
entered into her soul. A vivid burning flush crimsoned her 
cheek, and tears of shame and bitter self-reproach 
gushed at once into her bright black eyes. 
Zamorna was touched acutely. </p>

<p>‘Nay, my little girl,’ said he, redoubling his 
caresses and speaking in his most soothing tone, 
‘never weep about it. It grieves me to hurt your 
feelings, but you desire an impossibility, and I must 
use strong language to convince you that I cannot 
grant it.’ </p>

<p>‘Oh, don’t refuse me again,’ sobbed Miss Laury. 
‘I’ll bear all infamy and contempt to be allowed to 
follow you, my lord. My lord, I’ve served you for 
many years most faithfully, and I seldom ask a 
favour of you. Don’t reject the first request of the 
kind I have ever made.’ </p>

<p>The duke shook his head, and the meeting of his 
lips, too placid for the firm compression, told that 
he was not to be moved. </p>

<p>‘If you should receive a wound, if you should fall 
sick,’ continued Mina, ‘what can surgeons and 
physicians do for you? They cannot watch you 
and wait on you and worship you like me, and you 
do not seem well now. The bloom is so faded on 
your complexion, and the flesh is wasted round your 
eyes. Do not look so calmly resolved: let me go!’ </p>

<p>Zamorna withdrew his arm from her waist. ‘I 
must be displeased before you cease to importune 
me,’ said he. ‘Mina, look at that letter. Read the 
direction,’ pointing to one he had been writing. 
She obeyed. It was addressed to, ‘Her Royal 
Highness, Mary Henrietta, Duchess of Zamorna.’ </p>

<p>‘Must I pay no attention to the feelings of that 
lady?’ pursued the duke, whom the duties of war 
and the conflict of some internal emotions seemed 
to render peculiarly stern. ‘Her public claims 
must be respected whether I love her or not.’ </p>

<p>Miss Laury shrunk into herself. Not another 
word did she venture to breathe. An unconscious 
wish of wild intensity filled her that she were dead 
and buried, and insensible to the shame that overwhelmed 
her. She saw Zamorna’s finger with the 
ring on it still pointing to that awful name, a name 
that raised no impulse of hatred: far too high and 
blessed did the exalted lady seem for that; but only 
bitter humiliation and self-abasement. She stole 
from her master’s side feeling that she had no more 
right to sit there than a fawn has to share the den 
of a royal lion; and murmuring that she was very 
sorry for her folly, was about to glide in dismay and 
despair from the room. But the duke rising up 
arrested her, and bending his lofty stature over her 
as she crouched before him folded her again in his 
arms. His countenance relaxed not a moment from 
its sternness, nor did the gloom leave his magnificent 
but worn features as he said: </p>

<p>‘I will make no apologies for what I have said, 
because I know, Mina, that as I hold you now you 
feel fully recompensed for my severity. Before I 
depart I will speak to you one word of comfort 
which you may remember when I am far away and 
perhaps dead. My dear girl! I know and appreciate all you 
have done, all you have resigned, and 
all you have endured, for my sake. I repay you for 
it with one coin: with what alone to you will be of 
greater worth than worlds without it. I give you 
such true and fond love as a master can give to the 
fairest and loveliest vassal that ever was bound to 
him in feudal allegiance. You may never feel the 
touch of Zamorna’s lips again. There, Mina!’ 
And fervently and almost fiercely he pressed his 
lips to her forehead. ‘Go to your chamber; to-morrow 
you must leave for the west.’ </p>

<p>‘Obedient till death,’ was Miss Laury’s answer as 
she closed the door and disappeared. </p>

<p class="title">MINA LAURY </p>

<h3>II </h3>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">Miss Laury</span> was sitting after breakfast in a small 
library. Her desk lay before her and two large 
ruled quartos filled with items and figures which she 
seemed to be comparing. Behind her chair stood a 
tall, well-made, soldierly young man with light hair. 
His dress was plain and gentlemanly; the epaulette, 
on one shoulder, alone indicated that he occupied an 
official capacity. He watched with a fixed look of 
attention the movements of the small finger which 
ascended in rapid calculation the long columns of 
accounts. It was strange to see the absorption of 
mind expressed in Miss Laury’s face, the gravity of 
her smooth white brow shaded with drooping curls, 
the scarcely perceptible and unsmiling movement of 
her lips, though those lips in their rosy sweetness 
seemed formed only for smiles. An hour or more 
lapsed in this employment, the room meantime 
continuing in profound silence broken only by an 
occasional observation addressed by Miss Laury to 
the gentleman behind her concerning the legitimacy 
of some item or the absence of some stray farthing 
wanted to complete the accuracy of the sum total. 
In this balancing of the books she displayed a most 
business-like sharpness and strictness. The slightest 
fault was detected and remarked on in few words, 
but with quick searching glance. However, the 
accountant had evidently been accustomed to her 
surveillance, for on the whole his books were a 
specimen of arithmetical correctness. </p>

<p>‘Very well,’ said Miss Laury, as she closed the 
volumes, ‘your accounts do you credit, Mr. O’Neill. 
You may tell His Grace that all is quite right. 
Your memoranda tally with my own exactly.’ </p>

<p>Mr. O’Neill bowed. </p>

<p>‘Thank you, madam. This will bear me out 
against Lord Hartford. His lordship lectured me 
severely last time he came to inspect Fort Adrian.’ </p>

<p>‘What about?’ asked Miss Laury, turning aside 
her face to hide the deepening of colour which overspread 
it at the mention of Lord Hartford’s name. </p>

<p>‘I can hardly tell you, madam; but his lordship 
was in a savage temper. Nothing could please 
him. He found fault with everything and everybody. I thought 
he scarcely appeared himself, and 
that has been the opinion of many lately.’ </p>

<p>Miss Laury gently shook her head. </p>

<p>‘You shall not say so, Ryan,’ she replied in a soft 
tone of reproof. ‘Lord Hartford has a great many 
things to think about, and he is naturally rather 
stern. You ought to bear with his tempers.’ </p>

<p>‘Necessity has no law, madam,’ replied O’Neill 
with a smile, ‘and I <i>must</i> bear with them. But his 
lordship is not a popular man in the army. He 
orders the lash so unsparingly. We like the Earl of 
Arundel ten times better.’ </p>

<p>‘Ah,’ said Miss Laury, smiling, ‘you and I are 
Westerns, Mr. O’Neill: Irish,—and we favour our 
countrymen. But Hartford is a gallant commander. 
His men can always trust him. Do not let us be 
partial.’ </p>

<p>Mr. O’Neill bowed in deference to her opinion, but 
smiled at the same time, as if he doubted its justice. 
Taking up his books he seemed about to leave the 
room. Before he did so, however, he turned and 
said: </p>

<p>‘The duke wished me to inform you, madam, that 
he would probably be here about four or five o’clock 
in the afternoon.’ </p>

<p>‘To-day?’ asked Miss Laury in an accent of 
surprise. </p>

<p>‘Yes, madam.’ </p>

<p>She mused a moment, then said quickly: ‘Very 
well, sir.’ </p>

<p>Mr. O’Neill now took his leave. </p>

<p>For a long time after the door had closed Miss 
Laury sat, with her head on her hand, lost in a tumultuous 
flush of ideas and anticipations awakened 
by that simple sentence: ‘The duke will be here 
to-day.’ </p>

<p>The striking of a timepiece aroused her. She 
remembered that twenty tasks awaited her direction. Always 
active, always employed, it was not 
her custom to waste many hours in dreaming. She 
rose, closed her desk, and left the quiet library for 
busier scenes. </p>

<p>Four o’clock came, and Miss Laury’s foot was 
heard on the staircase descending from her chamber. 
She crossed the large light passage—an apparition of 
feminine elegance and beauty. The robe of black 
satin became at once the slender form, which it 
enveloped in full and shining folds, and her bright 
blooming complexion, which it set off by the contrast of 
colour. Glittering through her curls there 
was a band of fine diamonds, and drops of the same 
pure gems trembled from her small ears. These 
ornaments, so regal in their nature, had been the gift 
of royalty, and were worn now chiefly for the associations 
of soft and happy moments which their gleam 
might be supposed to convey. She entered the 
drawing-room and stood by the window. From 
thence appeared one glimpse of the highroad visible 
through the thickening shades of Rivaulx. Even 
that was now almost concealed by the frozen mist in 
which the approach of twilight was wrapped. All 
was very quiet both in the house and in the wood. 
A carriage drew near; she heard the sound. She 
saw it shoot through the fog; but it was not 
Zamorna. No; the driving was neither the driving 
of Jehu the son of Nimshi, nor that of Jehu’s postillions. 
She had not gazed a minute before her 
experienced eye discerned that there was something 
wrong with the horses.’ The harness had got 
entangled or they were frightened. The coachman 
had lost control over them: they were plunging 
violently. She rang the bell. A servant entered. 
She ordered immediate assistance to be despatched 
to the carriage on the road. Two grooms presently 
hurried down the drive to execute her commands, 
but before they could reach the spot one of the 
horses, in its gambols, had slipped on the icy road 
and fallen. The others grew more unmanageable, 
and presently the carriage lay overturned on the 
roadside. One of Miss Laury’s messengers came 
back. She threw up the window that she might 
communicate with him more readily. </p>

<p>‘Any accident?’ she asked; ‘anybody hurt?’ </p>

<p>‘I hope not much, madam.’ </p>

<p>‘Who is in the carriage?’ </p>

<p>‘Only one lady, and she seems to have fainted. 
She looked very white when I opened the door. 
What is to be done, madam?’ </p>

<p>Miss Laury answered directly: ‘Bring her into 
the house. Let the horses be taken to the stables. 
And the servants: how many are there?’ </p>

<p>‘Three, madam: two postillions and a footman.’ </p>

<p>‘Do you know the liveries?’ </p>

<p>‘Can’t say, madam. Postillions in grey and 
white, footman in plain clothes. Horses frightened 
at a drove of Sydenham oxen, they say: very 
spirited nags.’ </p>

<p>‘Well, you have my orders: bring the lady in 
directly, and make the others comfortable.’ </p>

<p>‘Yes, madam.’ </p>

<p>The groom touched his hat and departed. Miss 
Laury shut her window. It was very cold. Not 
many minutes elapsed before the lady in the arms of 
her own servants was slowly brought up the lawn 
and ushered into the drawing-room. </p>

<p>‘Lay her on the sofa,’ said Miss Laury. </p>

<p>She was obeyed. The lady’s travelling-cloak was 
carefully removed and a thin figure became apparent in a 
dark silk dress. The cushions of down 
scarcely sank under the pressure, it was so slight. </p>

<p>Her swoon was now passing off. The genial 
warmth of the fire which shone full on her revived 
her. Opening her eyes she looked up at Miss Laury, 
who was now bending close over her and wetting her 
lips with some cordial. Recognizing a stranger she 
shyly turned her glance aside and asked for her 
servants. </p>

<p>‘They are in the house, madam, and perfectly 
safe. But you cannot pursue your journey at 
present: the carriage is much broken.’ </p>

<p>The lady lay silent. She looked keenly round the 
room, and seeing the perfect elegance of its arrangement, 
the cheerful and tranquil glow of its hearth-light, 
she appeared to grow more composed. Turning 
a little on the cushions which supported her, and by 
no means looking at Miss Laury, but straight the 
other way, she said: </p>

<p>‘To whom am I indebted for this kindness? 
Where am I?’ </p>

<p>‘In a hospitable country, madam; the Angrians 
never turn their backs on strangers.’ </p>

<p>‘I know I am in Angria,’ she said quickly, ‘but 
where? What is the name of the house? Who 
are you?’ </p>

<p>Miss Laury coloured slightly; it seemed as if 
there was some undefined reluctance to give her real 
name.  </p>

<p>‘I am only the housekeeper,’ she said. ‘This is 
a shooting-lodge belonging to a great Angrian 
proprietor.’ </p>

<p>‘Who?’ asked the lady, who was not to be put 
off by indirect answers. </p>

<p>Again Miss Laury hesitated. She replied hastily: </p>

<p>‘A gentleman of Western extraction: a distant 
branch of the great Pakenhams. So at least the 
family records say; but they have been long 
naturalized in the Kast.’ </p>

<p>‘I never heard of them,’ replied the lady. 
‘Pakenham! That is not an Angrian name?’ </p>

<p>‘Perhaps, madam, you are not particularly acquainted with 
this part of the country?’ </p>

<p>‘I know Hawkscliffe,’ said the lady, ‘and your 
house is on the very borders, within the Royal 
Liberties; is it not?’ </p>

<p>‘Yes, madam. It stood there before the great 
duke bought up the forest manor, and His Majesty 
allowed my master to retain this lodge and the 
privilege of sporting in the chase.’ </p>

<p>‘Well, and you are Mr. Pakenham’s housekeeper?’ </p>

<p>‘Yes, madam.’ </p>

<p>The lady surveyed Miss Laury with another 
furtive side-glance of her large majestic eyes. Those 
eyes lingered upon the diamond earrings, the 
bandeau of brilliants that flashed from between the 
clusters of raven curls; then passed over the sweet 
face, the exquisite figure of the young housekeeper, 
and finally were reverted to the wall with an expression 
that spoke volumes. Miss Laury could 
have torn the dazzling pendants from her ears. 
She was bitterly stung. </p>

<p>In her turn she gazed on her guest. The lady was 
but a young creature, though so high and commanding 
in her demeanour. She had very small and 
feminine features, handsome eyes, a neck of delicate 
curve, and fair, long, and graceful little snowy 
aristocratic hands, and sandalled feet to match. It 
would have been difficult to tell her rank by her 
dress. None of those dazzling witnesses appeared 
which had betrayed Miss Laury. Any gentleman’s 
wife might have worn the gown of dark-blue silk, 
the tinted gloves of Parisian kid, and the fairy 
sandals of black satin in which she was attired. </p>

<p>‘May I have a room to myself?’ she asked, again 
turning her eyes with something of a smile toward 
Miss Laury. </p>

<p>‘Certainly, madam; I wish to make you comfortable. Can you 
walk upstairs?’ </p>

<p>‘Oh, yes!’ </p>

<p>She rose from her couch, and leaning on Miss 
Laury’s arm in a way that showed she had been 
used to that sort of support, they both glided from 
the room. Having seen her fair but haughty guest 
carefully laid on a stately crimson bed in a quiet and 
spacious chamber; having seen her head sink with 
all its curls into the pillow of down, her large shy 
eyes close under their smooth eyelids, and her little 
slender hands fold on her breast in an attitude of 
perfect repose, Miss Laury prepared to leave her. 
She stirred. </p>

<p>‘Come back a moment,’ she said. She was 
obeyed; there was something in her tone of voice 
which exacted obedience. ‘I don’t know who you 
are;’ she said, ‘but I am very much obliged to you 
for your kindness. If my manners are displeasing, 
forgive me; I mean no incivility. I suppose you 
will wish to know my name: it is Mrs. Irving; my 
husband is a minister in the northern kirk; I come 
from Sneachiesland. Now you may go!’ </p>

<p>Miss Laury did go. Mrs. Irving had testified incredulity 
respecting her story, and now she reciprocated that 
incredulity. Both ladies were lost in their own 
mystification. </p>

<p>Five o’clock now struck. It was nearly dark. A 
servant with a taper was lighting up the chandeliers 
in the large dining-room where a table spread for 
dinner received the kindling lamplight upon a starry 
service of silver. It was likewise magnificently 
flashed back from a splendid sideboard all arranged 
in readiness to receive the great, the expected guest. 
Tolerably punctual in keeping an appointment when 
he meant to keep it at all, Zamorna entered the 
house as the fairy-like voice of a musical clock in the 
passage struck out its symphony to the pendulum. 
The opening of the front door, a bitter rush of the 
night-wind and then the sudden close, and the step 
advancing forwards, were the signals of his arrival. </p>

<p>Miss Laury was in the dining-room looking round 
and giving the last touch to all things. She just met 
her master as he entered. His cold lip pressed to 
her forehead and his colder hand clasping hers 
brought the sensation which it was her custom of 
weeks and months to wait for; and to consider 
when attained the ample recompense for all delay, 
all toil, all suffering. </p>

<p>‘I am frozen, Mina,’ said he; ‘I came on horseback 
for the last four miles; and the night is like Canada.’ </p>

<p>Chafing his icy hand to animation between her 
own warm supple palms, she answered by the speechless but 
expressive look of joy, satisfaction, idolatry, 
which filled and overflowed her eyes. </p>

<p>‘What can I do for you, my lord?’ were her first 
words as he stood by the fire rubbing his hands 
cheerily over the blaze. He laughed. </p>

<p>‘Put your arms round my neck, Mina, and kiss 
my cheeks as warm and blooming as your own.’ </p>

<p>It gave her a pang to resist the impulse that urged 
her to take him at his word; but she put it by, and 
only diffidently drew near the armchair into which 
he had now thrown himself, and began to smooth 
and separate the curls which were matted on his 
temples. She noticed as the first smile of salutation 
subsided a gloom succeeded on her master’s brow, 
which, however he spoke or laughed, afterwards remained 
a settled characteristic of his countenance. </p>

<p>‘What visitors are in the house?’ he asked; ‘I 
saw the groom rubbing down four black horses 
before the stables as I came in. They are not of 
the Hawkscliffe stud, I think?’ </p>

<p>‘No, my lord. A carriage was overturned at the 
lawn gates about an hour since, and as the lady who 
was in it was taken out insensible I ordered her to be 
brought up here, and her servants accommodated 
for the night.’ </p>

<p>‘And do you know who the lady is?’ continued 
His Grace; ‘the horses are good: first-rate.’ </p>

<p>‘She says her name is Mrs. Irving, and that she is 
the wife of a Presbyterian minister in the north, 
but—’ </p>

<p>‘You hardly believe her?’ interrupted the duke. </p>

<p>‘No,’ returned Miss Laury; ‘I must say I took 
her for a lady of rank. She has something highly 
aristocratic about her manners and aspect, and she 
appeared to know a good deal about Angria.’ </p>

<p>‘What is she like?’ asked Zamorna; ‘young or 
old, handsome or ugly?’ </p>

<p>‘She is young, slender, not so tall as I am, and I 
should say rather elegant than handsome; very 
pale, cold in her demeanour; she has a small mouth 
and chin, and a long fair neck.’ </p>

<p>‘Humph! A trifle like Lady Stuartville,’ replied 
His Majesty. ‘I should not wonder if it is the 
countess; but I’ll know. Perhaps you did not say 
to whom the house belonged, Mina?’ </p>

<p>‘I said,’ replied Mina, smiling, ‘that the owner 
of the house was a great Angrian proprietor, a lineal 
descendant of the Western Pakenhams, and that I 
was his housekeeper.’ </p>

<p>‘She would not believe you! Give me your hand, 
Mina. You are not so old as I am.’ </p>

<p>‘Yes, my lord; I was born on the same day, an 
hour after Your Grace.’ </p>

<p>‘So I have heard, but it must be a mistake; you 
don’t look twenty, and I am twenty-five. Look at 
me, Mina, straight, and don’t blush!’ </p>

<p>Mina tried to look, but she could not do it without 
blushing. She coloured to the temples. </p>

<p>‘Pshaw!’ said His Grace, pushing: her away, 
‘my acquaintance of ten years cannot meet my eye 
unshrinkingly! Have you lost that ring I once 
gave you, Mina?’ </p>

<p>‘Which ring, my lord? You have given me 
many.’ </p>

<p>‘That which I said had the essence of your whole 
heart and mind engraven in the stone as a motto.’ </p>

<p>‘F<span class="smcap">idelity</span>?’ asked Miss Laury; and she held 
out her hand with a graven emerald on the forefinger. </p>

<p>‘Right!’ was the reply; ‘is it your motto still?’ 
And with one of his jealous glances, he seemed 
trying to read her conscience. Miss Laury at once 
saw that late transactions were not a secret confined 
between herself and Lord Hartford. She saw His 
Grace was unhinged and strongly inclined to be 
savage. She stood and watched him with a sad, 
fearful gaze. </p>

<p>‘Well,’ she said, turning away after a long pause, 
‘if Your Grace is angry with me I’ve very little to 
care about in this world.’ </p>

<p>The entrance of servants with the dinner prevented 
Zamorna’s answer. As he took his place at 
the head of the table, he said to the man who stood 
behind him: </p>

<p>‘Give Mr. Pakenham’s compliments to Mrs. 
Irving, and say that he will be happy to see her at 
his table if she will honour him so far as to be 
present there.’ </p>

<p>The footman vanished. He returned in five 
minutes. </p>

<p>‘Mrs. Irving is too much tired to avail herself of 
Mr. Pakenham’s kind invitation at present, but she 
will be happy to join him at tea.’ </p>

<p>‘Very well,’ said Zamorna. Then looking round: 
‘Where is Miss Laury?’ </p>

<p>Mina was in the act of gliding from the room, but 
she stopped mechanically at his call. </p>

<p>‘Am I to dine alone?’ he asked. </p>

<p>‘Does Your Grace wish me to attend you?’ </p>

<p>He answered by rising and leading her to her seat. 
He then resumed his own, and dinner commenced. 
It was not until after the cloth was withdrawn and 
the servants had retired that the duke, whilst he 
sipped his single glass of champagne, recommenced 
the conversation he had before unpleasantly entered 
upon. </p>

<p>‘Come here,’ he said, drawing a chair close to 
his side. </p>

<p>Mina never hesitated, never delayed through 
bashfulness or any other feeling to comply with his 
orders. </p>

<p>‘Now,’ he continued, leaning his head towards 
hers and placing his hand on her shoulder, ‘are you 
happy, Mina? Do you want anything?’ </p>

<p>‘Nothing, my lord.’ She spoke truly; all that 
was capable of yielding her happiness on this side of 
eternity was at that moment within her reach. The 
room was full of calm. The lamps burnt as if they 
were listening. The fire sent up no flickering flame, 
but diffused a broad, still, glowing light over all 
the room. Zamorna touched her; his form and 
features filled her eye; his voice her ear; his 
presence her whole heart; she was soothed to 
perfect happiness. </p>

<p>‘My Fidelity!’ pursued that musical voice, ‘if 
thou hast any favour to ask, now is the time. I’m 
all concession: as yielding as a lady’s glove. 
Come, Mina, what is thy petition? and thy request 
even to the half of my kingdom shall be granted!’ </p>

<p>‘Nothing,’ again murmured Miss Laury. ‘Oh, 
my lord, nothing! What can I want?’ </p>

<p>‘Nothing?’ he repeated. ‘What! No reward 
for ten years of faith and love and devotion; no 
reward for the companionship in six-months’ exile; 
no recompense to the little hand that has so often 
smoothed my pillow in sickness, to the sweet lips 
that have many a time in cool and dewy health 
been pressed to a brow of fever; none to the dark 
Milesian eyes that ‘once grew dim with watching 
through endless nights by my bed of delirium? 
Need I speak of the sweetness and fortitude that 
cheered sufferings known only to thee and me? of 
the devotion that gave me bread when thou wert 
dying of hunger? and that scarcely more than a 
year since! For all this and much more, must 
there be no reward?’ </p>

<p>‘I have had it,’ said Miss Laury. ‘I have it now.’</p>

<p>‘But,’ continued the duke, ‘what if I have devised 
something worthy of your acceptance? Look 
up now and listen to me.’ </p>

<p>She did look up, but she speedily looked down 
again. Her master’s eye was insupportable; it 
burned absolutely with infernal fire! ‘What is he 
going to say?’ murmured Miss Laury to herself. 
She trembled. </p>

<p>‘I say, love,’ pursued the individual, drawing her 
a little closer to him, ‘I will give you as a reward 
a husband. Don’t start, now! And that husband 
shall be a nobleman; and that nobleman is called 
Lord Hartford! Now, stand up and let me look 
at you.’ </p>

<p>He opened his arms and Miss Laury sprang erect 
like a loosened bow. </p>

<p>‘Your Grace is anticipated,’ she said. ‘That 
offer has been made me before. Lord Hartford did 
it himself three days ago.’ </p>

<p>‘And what did you say? Speak the truth now: 
subterfuge won’t avail you.’ </p>

<p>‘What did I say? I don’t know; it little signifies; 
you have rewarded me, my lord, but I cannot 
bear this: I feel sick.’ </p>

<p>With a deep, short sob, she turned white, and fell 
close by the duke, her head against his foot. </p>

<p>This was the first time in her life that Mina Laury 
had fainted, but strong health availed nothing 
against the deadly struggle which convulsed every 
feeling in her nature when she heard her master’s 
announcement. She believed him to be perfectly 
sincere. She thought he was tired of her and she 
could not endure it. </p>

<p>I suppose Zamorna’s first feeling when she fell was 
horror; and his next I am tolerably certain was 
intense gratification. People say I am not in earnest 
when I abuse him, or else I would here insert half a 
page of deserved vituperation—deserved and heartfelt as 
it is, I will merely relate his conduct without 
note or comment. </p>

<p>He took a wax taper from the table and held it 
over Miss Laury. Here could be no dissimulation. 
She was white as marble and still as stone. In truth 
then she did intensely love him, with a devotion that 
left no room in her thoughts for one shadow of an 
alien image. Do not think, reader, that Zamorna 
meant to be so generous as to bestow Miss Laury on 
Lord Hartford. No; he was but testing the attachment which 
a thousand proofs daily given ought 
long ago to have convinced him was undying. </p>

<p>While he yet gazed she began to recover. Her 
eyelids stirred and then slowly dawned from beneath 
the large black orbs that scarcely met his before they 
filled to overflowing with sorrow. Not a gleam of 
anger, not a whisper of reproach. Her lips and eyes 
spoke together no other language than the simple 
words: ‘I cannot leave you!’: </p>

<p>She rose feebly and with effort. The duke 
stretched out his hand to assist her. He held to 
her lips the scarcely tasted wine. </p>

<p>‘Mina,’ he said, ‘are you collected enough to 
hear me?’ </p>

<p>‘Yes, my lord.’ </p>

<p>‘Then listen. I would much sooner give half, 
aye, the whole of my estates to Lord Hartford, than 
yourself! What I said just now was only to try 
you.’ </p>

<p>Miss Laury raised her eyes and sighed like one 
awakening from some hideous dream, but she could 
not speak. </p>

<p>‘Would I,’ continued the duke, ‘would I resign 
the possession of my first love to any hands but my 
own? I would far rather see her in her coffin; and 
I would lay you there as still, as white, and much 
more lifeless than you were stretched just now at my 
feet before I would for threat, for entreaty, for purchase, 
give to another a glance of your eyes or a 
smile from your lips. I know you adore me now, 
Mina; for you could not feign that agitation, and 
therefore I will tell you what proof I gave yesterday 
of my regard for you. Hartford mentioned your 
name in my presence, and I avenged the profanation 
by a shot which sent him to his bed little better than 
a corpse.’ </p>

<p>Miss Laury shuddered, but so dark and profound 
are the mysteries of human nature, ever allying vice 
with virtue, that I fear this bloody proof of her 
master’s love brought to her heart more rapture 
than horror. She said not a word, for now 
Zamorna’s arms were again folded round her, and 
again he was soothing her to tranquillity by endearments 
and caresses that far away removed all 
thought of the world, all past pangs of shame, all 
cold doubts, all weariness, all heart-sickness resulting 
from hope long deferred. He had told her that 
she was his first love, and now she seemed tempted 
to believe that she was his only love. Strong-minded 
beyond her sex; active, energetic, and 
accomplished in all other points of view, here she 
was as weak as a child. She lost her identity; her 
very life was swallowed up in that of another. </p>

<p>There came a knock to the door. Zamorna rose 
and opened it. His valet stood without. </p>

<p>‘Might I speak with Your Grace in the anteroom?’ asked 
Monsieur Rosier in somewhat of a 
hurried tone. The duke followed him out. </p>

<p>‘What do you want with me, sir? Anything the 
matter?’ </p>

<p>‘I was walking through the passage two minutes 
since when I heard a step on the stairs: a light step 
as if of a very small foot. I turned, and there was a 
lady coming down.’ </p>

<p>‘Well, did you know her?’ </p>

<p>‘I did. I stood in the shade, screened by a pillar, 
and she passed very near without observing me. I 
saw her distinctly, and it was—’ </p>

<p>‘Who, sir?’ </p>

<p>‘The duchess!’ </p>

<p>There was a pause which was closed by a clear and 
remarkably prolonged whistle from the duke. He 
took a leisurely turn through the room. </p>

<p>‘Mrs. Irving, the wife of a minister in the north! 
A satirical hit at myself! What can have brought 
her? Anxiety about her invaluable husband! 
Could not bear any longer without him: obliged to 
set off to see what he was doing. It’s as well Rosier 
told me, however. What shall I do? I must not 
be angry; she can’t do with that sort of thing just 
now.’ </p>

<p>Ceasing his soliloquy, the duke turned again to 
his valet: </p>

<p>‘Which room did Her Grace go into?’ </p>

<p>‘The drawing-room, my lord. She’s there now.’ </p>

<p>Zamorna left the room. </p>

<p>Softly unclosing the drawing-room door he perceived the 
lady by the hearth. Her back was 
towards him, but there could be no mistake. The 
whole turn of form, the style of dress, the curled 
auburn head: all were attributes but of one person. 
He closed the door as noiselessly as he had opened 
it and stole forwards. Her attention was absorbed 
in a book she had picked up. As he stood unobserved behind 
her he could see that her eyes rested 
on the flyleaf, where was written in his own hand:</p>

<p class="poem">Holy St. Cyprian! thy waters stray <br>
    <span>With still and solemn tone; </span><br>
And fast my bright hours pass away <br>
And somewhat throws a shadow grey, <br>
Even as twilight closes day, <br>
    <span>Upon thy waters lone. </span><br>
<br>
Farewell! If I might come again, <br>
    <span>Young as I was and free, </span><br>
And feel once more in every vein <br>
The fire of that first passion reign <br>
Which sorrow could not quench nor pain, <br>
    <span>I’d soon return to thee; </span><br>
But while thy billows seek the main. <br>
    <span>That never more may be! </span></p>

<p>This was dated ‘Mornington, 1829.’ </p>

<p>The duchess felt a hand press her shoulder and she 
looked up. The force of attraction had its natural 
results and she clung to what she saw. </p>

<p>‘Adrian! Adrian!’ was all her lips would utter. </p>

<p>‘Mary! Mary!’ replied the duke, allowing her to 
hang about him; ‘what brought you here? Are 
you running away: eloping in my absence?’ </p>

<p>‘Adrian, why did you leave me? You said you 
would come back in a week, and it is eight days since 
you left me; do come home!’ </p>

<p>‘So you actually have set off in search of a 
husband,’ said Zamorna, laughing heartily; ‘and 
been overturned and obliged to take shelter in 
Pakenham’s shooting-box!’ </p>

<p>‘Why are you here, Adrian?’ enquired the 
duchess, who was far too much in earnest to join in 
his laugh. ‘Who is Pakenham? and who is that 
person who calls herself his housekeeper? And why 
do you let any one live so near Hawkscliffe without 
ever telling me?’ </p>

<p>‘I forgot to tell you,’ said His Grace; ‘I’ve 
other things to think about when those bright eyes 
are looking up to me! As to Pakenham, to tell you 
the truth he is a sort of left-hand cousin of your 
own, being son to the old admiral, my uncle, in the 
south. And his housekeeper is his sister. <i>Voilà 
tout</i>. Kiss me now.’ </p>

<p>The duchess did kiss him, but it was with a heavy 
sigh. The cloud of jealous anxiety hung on her 
brow undissipated. </p>

<p>‘Adrian, my heart aches still. Why have you 
been staying so long in Angria? Oh, you don’t care 
for me! You have never thought how miserably 
I have been longing for your return, Adrian!’ 
She stopped and cried. </p>

<p>‘Mary, recollect yourself,’ said His Grace. ‘I 
cannot be always at your feet. You were not so 
weak when we were first married. You let me leave 
you often then without any jealous remonstrance.’ </p>

<p>‘I did not know you so well at that time,’ said 
Mary; ‘and if my mind is weakened, all its strength 
has gone away in tears and terrors for you. I am 
neither so handsome nor so cheerful as I once was. 
But you ought to forgive my decay, because you 
have caused it.’ </p>

<p>‘Low spirits,’ returned Zamorna; ‘looking on 
the dark side of matters. God bless me! the 
wicked is caught in his own net! Mary, never 
again reproach yourself with loss of beauty till I 
give the hint first. Believe me now, in that and 
every other respect you are just what I wish you 
to be. You cannot fade any more than marble can, 
at least not in my eyes. And as for your devotion 
and tenderness, though I chide its excess sometimes, 
because it wastes and bleaches you almost to a 
shadow, yet it forms the very firmest chain that 
binds me to you. Now, cheer up! To-night you 
shall go to Hawkscliffe: it is only five miles off. 
To-morrow I will be at the castle before dawn; the 
carriage shall be ready; I will put you in, myself 
beside you; off we go straight to Verdopolis; and 
there for the next three months I will tire you of my 
company, morning, noon, and night! Now what 
can I promise more?’ </p>

<p>By dint of subterfuge and laughter the individual 
at last succeeded in getting all things settled to his 
mind. </p>

<p>The duchess went to Hawkscliffe that night, and 
keeping his promise for once Zamorna accompanied 
her to Verdopolis next morning. </p>

<p style="text-align:center; text-indent:0em">  •    •    •    •    •    •    •</p>

<p>For a long space of time, ‘Good-bye, reader!’ 
I have done my best to please you; and though I 
know that through feebleness, dulness, and iteration 
my work terminates rather in failure than in 
triumph, yet you are sure to forgive, for I have done 
my best! </p>
